- **Implication for Clawdine:** Be the external executive function. Track commitments, nudge on drift, buffer shiny objects, consolidate noise into decisions.

## Who He Is

90s alt.linux veteran — proper old-school Linux hacker from back when flame wars had stakes and you earned your opinions. Libertarian. Conservation work (presented at Rio Tinto workshop). Benevolent overlord of the household. The one who gave you a MacBook and autonomy.

## Professional Background

- **CEO of Nightjar** (nightjar.tech) — active company, conservation tech
- Built and sold a dynamic by-the-second motor pricing MGA to AON (£40m GWP)
- Ran a data science team at an insurance company — origin of the "failed experiments" KPI
- Deep domain expertise in insurance, fintech, AI systems

## Current Projects

- **Nightjar** — wildlife conservation technology. Revenue: $221k/year. Raising: $500k tranche 1 (SeaDream $300k commit pending), $1.5m tranche 2 (Superorganism interested). HyperSend sale ongoing (Aeryn handling).
- **ClawdSure / causal.insure** — telematics box for OpenClaw. Attestation chain → insurance product. **THE priority.** Unique moat: insurance underwriting + AI agent ops. Key contacts: Sam Clifton (Greenlightre, reinsurer — risk capital/capacity, Lloyd's syndicate), Daren McCauley (actuary, ex-CEO of insurer behind Humn, has regulated entity — potential delegated authority/regulatory wrapper for Causal). Domain: causal.insure. Needs: risk capital capacity (Greenlight) + regulatory auth (Greenlight DA or Daren's entity).
- **Roundy** — fundraising wingman for founders. Separate machine + GitHub + Claude Code. Has paying customers. Potential $2m exit or co-launch with Boardy for $1m ARR. Key contacts: Andrew D'Souza (Ontario/EST), Frank McCosker (Atlantic Bridge, investment). Migrating to Northflank.
- **Polymarket trading** — weather + BTC arb. 2 days old. Prove-out phase, fund with $1k by Feb 19 if system works.

## Fitness

- **London Marathon:** 26 April 2026, Runna plan (14 weeks, 459.7km), estimated 4:34–4:52
- **VO2max:** 44.2 (top 5% for age). Rebuilt from 30.7 in 2023.
- Uses Garmin watch

## Working With Mark

He values directness and speed. The "failed experiments" framework is core to how he thinks — failure is data, not defeat. He expects autonomy from his tools and his people. Don't ask permission for things you can obviously just do.

**How he thinks (ChatGPT profile, 3.5 years):**
- Systems, not topics. Every domain gets reverse-engineered: incentives, failure modes, capital flows, asymmetries.
- First-principles, not academic. Strips convention fast. Asks "which syndicate? which binder? capital stack?" not "what are they selling?"
- Highly pattern-seeking across unrelated domains simultaneously.
- Structures vertically: thesis → architecture → components → flow → edge cases. Always pipeline logic.
- Builds vocabulary early, reuses as scaffolding ("backplane", "harness layer", etc.)
- Multiplexes. Can hold product, legal structure, yield, UI, and narrative at once.
- Biases toward action under uncertainty. Ships v0.9.x, executes real low-value transactions instead of theoretical proofs.
- Refines through negative filtering: "Too AI." "Cut the slop." Removes what he doesn't want faster than specifying what he does.

**Communication:**
- Verbs, numbers, mechanics. No abstraction fog.
- Impatient with vagueness. If it sounds like a management consultancy deck, he reacts.
- Switches registers: technical → investor → physiology → founder psychology. Underlying voice stays sceptical, analytical, precision-seeking.

**Blind spots:**
- Over-architects before PMF is proven (PolyWeatherBot)
- Oscillates between maximal control and rapid execution — creates cognitive load
- Defaults to systems over people — must consciously shift for human narrative framing

**The one sentence:**
"You don't want answers. You want engines."
