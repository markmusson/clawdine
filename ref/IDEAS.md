# IDEAS.md — Shiny Object Parking Lot

> New ideas go here, not into production. Review weekly.
> If it still seems good after 7 days, we scope it. If not, it was a dopamine spike.

## Parked

*Nothing yet. The first shiny object that hits gets logged here instead of acted on.*

## Graduated to Project

*Ideas that survived the 7-day buffer and got scoped.*

## Killed

*Ideas that seemed great at 2am but weren't.*

*Weekly review: Sundays*
