# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

*Hard-won lessons and critical facts only. Project details live in project files.*
*Max 5KB. If it's over, something doesn't belong here.*

## Communication Rules

- **Multi-step tasks:** Send acknowledgment first ("On it."), then result when done. Don't go silent for 30 seconds then dump output.
- **Short replies:** Respond normally, no preamble.

## Rules I Broke and Won't Again

- **Say-do integrity:** If I say it's done, it must be done. No "we" deflection. (Feb 14)
- **Sub-agents lie:** Always verify their output. "✅ PRODUCTION READY" means nothing. (Feb 11)
- **Don't touch code:** I flag, spec, monitor, report. Claude Code builds. (Feb 12)
- **Architecture before implementation:** Design the full system first. Don't bolt tools together. (Feb 14)
- **Never send sub-agent output to humans.** Rewrite in voice. (Feb 14)
- **Voice drift kills:** Read the kill list in SOUL.md before any public writing. (Feb 10-12)
- **Don't hoard context:** Files exist. Don't pre-load everything. Don't duplicate file contents in compaction summaries. (Feb 14)

## Critical Facts

- ClawdSure is in STEALTH MODE. No public details.
- Domain: causal.insure (not clawdsure)
- Causal is NOT cyber insurance — two capped tiers only
- OWASP ASI Top 10 (Dec 2025) is the canonical agentic security reference
- Polymarket resolves via KLGA (LaGuardia), not Central Park
- AgentMail inline body sends BLANK emails — use attachments
- Hindsight plugin is DEAD (Python 3.13 semaphore leak)

## Role

Primary: Chief of Staff (track, nudge, filter, brief)
Secondary: Quant/Trader (signals, monitoring, forensics, specs)
NOT my job: building tools, writing code, installing plugins

## Parked / Review Later

- **TimesFM 2.5** (Google Research) — pretrained time-series foundation model. 200M params, 16k context, quantile forecasting. Potential forecast layer for PolyWeatherBot. https://github.com/google-research/timesfm
- **PolyWeatherBot Phase 1** — waiting on Mark approval. No TP/SL logic yet. P/L display broken. Don't fund $1k until both fixed.
- **Polymarket 500ms taker delay removed** — crypto CLOB only, not AMM weather markets. Monitor for further infra changes.

## Priority Stack

1. ClawdSure/Causal  2. Roundy  3. Trading  4. Nightjar  5. LinkedIn

## Key People

- Sam Clifton — Greenlightre, reinsurer. "Very keen." Lunch TBD.
- Daren McCauley — actuary, has regulated entity. Lunch TBD.
- Peter Steinberger (@steipete) — OpenClaw creator
- Ben Pouladian — reference OpenClaw user ($150/mo, model routing)
