## Platform Shift Note (Feb 7, 2026)

**IMPORTANT:** Polymarket has discontinued daily weather temperature markets. Kalshi is now the primary platform for weather trading. However, Kalshi creates daily temperature markets **same-day only** (no multi-day advance markets).

**Strategy Adjustment:**
- Daily temperature: Same-day only, tighter edge (1-2°F forecast error vs 7-9°F multi-day)
- Monthly accumulation (snow/rain): Better edge potential - forecasts are less reliable over weeks
- Focus on: **NO positions on precision accumulation when extended forecasts contradict**
