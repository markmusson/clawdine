WARN
gateway.trusted_proxies_missing Reverse proxy headers are not trusted
  gateway.bind is loopback and gateway.trustedProxies is empty. If you expose the Control UI through a reverse proxy, configure trusted proxies so local-client checks cannot be spoofed.
  Fix: Set gateway.trustedProxies to your proxy IPs or keep the Control UI local-only.
models.weak_tier Some configured models are below recommended tiers
  Smaller/older models are generally more susceptible to prompt injection and tool misuse.
- anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 (Haiku tier (smaller model)) @ agents.list.groups-lite.model.primary
  Fix: Use the latest, top-tier model for any bot with tools or untrusted inboxes. Avoid Haiku tiers; prefer GPT-5+ and Claude 4.5+.
