Greenlight Re. Reinsurer. Risk capital/capacity, Lloyd's syndicate. Very keen to hear more (replied Feb 12). Lunch being scheduled. Provided key product positioning feedback Feb 14: not cyber, two capped tiers, exclude enterprise, Linux in 1994 framing.

## Feb 13 Beers — Key Takeaways
- Positioning advice: two tiers, not enterprise cyber. B2C parametric + SME capped.
- "Day 1 like Linux 1994" story arc for underwriters who don't know the tech.
- Uses Sonnet 4.5 personally — reviewing CLN conversion clauses on phone at pub.
- Engaged enough to co-design GTM. Not just polite interest.
- Called Clawdine "fancy Apache Airflow" — sees orchestration, skeptical on intelligence.
- Next: Mark needs internal Causal design work before scheduling formal follow-up.
