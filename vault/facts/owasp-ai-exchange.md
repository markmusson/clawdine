CRITICAL — Real AI security standards body at owaspai.org. OWASP Flagship, 300+ pages, 70+ experts. Contributed to EU AI Act and ISO/IEC 27090. Our attestation checks map to their taxonomy. When underwriters ask what standard: OWASP AI Exchange + ISO 27090. The OWASP Agentic Top 10 2026 was HALLUCINATED by sub-agent — does not exist.
