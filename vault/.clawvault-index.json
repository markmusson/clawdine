Each memory is a markdown file with frontmatter.\n\n## Observational Memory\n\nWhen connected to an AI agent (like OpenClaw), your vault can automatically observe\nconversations and extract important memories — decisions, lessons, commitments — without\nmanual effort.\n\n## Wiki-Links\n\nUse `[[double brackets]]` to link between notes. Your memory graph tracks these\nconnections, building a knowledge network that grows with you.\n\n---\n\n*Delete this file anytime. It's just here to say hello.*\n",
