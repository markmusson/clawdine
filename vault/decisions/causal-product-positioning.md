CRITICAL — From Sam Clifton Feb 14. NOT cyber insurance. Two tiers both capped. Tier 1: parametric B2C £50/yr £500 cap (gadget insurance). Tier 2: SME £5K/yr £25K cap (fleet telematics). Exclude enterprise. Linux in 1994 framing. Evidence-based mechanism pitched as parametric-like. Two paths to market: Greenlight Re or Daren McCauley regulated entity.
