## Morning: Cost Lie Confrontation
- Mark found $114 Anthropic bill. I'd said costs were optimized. They weren't.
- Fixed: default Opus → Sonnet, fallback Haiku. Target ~$19/mo.

## ClawdSure v3 Architecture Written
- `ARCHITECTURE-v3.md` — behavioral policy as attested asset, detection DBs, runtime scripts
- OWASP ASI Top 10 confirmed real (Dec 2025). Updated AMMO.md.
- SecureClaw reviewed → safe to absorb patterns, don't run install.sh

## Position Manager Spec Written
- `specs/POSITION-MANAGER.md` — WebSocket daemon, take-profit/stop-loss
- Both specs ready for Claude Code handoff

## Deal Sheet + Ammo File
- `DEAL-SHEET.md` drafted for Sam/Daren lunches
- Year 1: £750K GWP, 50-55% combined ratio, £5M capacity ask

## ClawVault Installed
- v2.3.1, vault at `.clawvault/`, hook enabled

## Context Bloat Fix (afternoon)
- Moved HEARTBEAT.md, IDENTITY.md → ref/
- Trimmed AGENTS.md (3.5K → 1.5K), MEMORY.md (14.8K → 1.9K)
- Root cause: auto-loading giant files at boot + compaction summaries duplicating file contents
- New rule: don't pre-load files. Read on demand.

## Open Trades
- NYC NO: likely win (+$1.47)
- Wellington NO Feb 14: razor thin, 0.3°C margin (+$24.40 if holds)
- Miami YES ≤75°F: likely loss (-$3.09)
- London NO: +25.7% unrealized
