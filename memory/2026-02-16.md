# 2026-02-16 — Monday Session Log

## Grok/xAI skill installed
- `clawhub install grok` — xAI search skill (web + X/Twitter) by @cstanley
- Needs xAI API key from console.x.ai — not yet provided
- xAI ToS strict: no public key sharing, no public forums, audit logs. Key in Keychain only.
- Replaces Twitter API dependency entirely

## PolyWeatherBot — Hummingbot analysis
- Sub-agent cloned hummingbot/hummingbot, wrote 50KB analysis
- Decision: don't fork (135K lines, 80% irrelevant). Steal 5 patterns, build ~3K-line bot
- Patterns: connector abstraction, ClientOrderTracker, triple barrier risk, controller/executor, P/L formula
- Claude Code brief: `projects/hummingbot-analysis/CLAUDE-CODE-BRIEF.md`
- Emailed to Mark, awaiting notes before CC handoff
- Supersedes both Position Manager spec and reconciliation rewrite
- KEY RULE: system must continuously poll Polymarket APIs for live portfolio state. Local must match remote at all times. Not a one-off reconcile, not a hardcoded number.

## AMMO.md updated with 4 new entries
- Adam Kling/CrewAI: 100% enterprises expanding agents, 95% failed in production. Goldman zero-trust approach.
- Mark's PR #17345 to OpenClaw — core contributor credibility for Sam pitch
- Claw Score external audit framework
- Hummingbot architecture reference

## Mark's OpenClaw PR #17345
- "Runner memory rebuild: token budgeting, recall caps, incremental summary state"
- 7 commits covering Phases 1, 2, 3, 5 of memory kernel rebuild
- Greptile 4/5 confidence
- Posted reply under @levelsio tweet (322K views) about persistent memory — perfect placement
- Robert Pop (@robipop22) has competing 3-layer approach (SQLite+Qdrant+Postgres graph) — overengineered userspace workaround vs Mark's infrastructure fix

## Autonomous loop fixed
- Was spamming Mark about Kevin Webb email despite being told to park it — loop kept re-alerting
- Patched: email checking OFF, no re-alerting on acknowledged items, added commitment deadline check
- Email triage stays OFF until Mark explicitly re-enables

## Morning brief patched
- Was reading stale data, reporting fake paper trader win rates
- Updated prompt: reads COMMITMENTS + yesterday's memory, flags paper trader as fiction, skips email, checks PR merge status

## Instructions to remember
- Email triage OFF until Mark says otherwise
- Don't notify about agentmail inbox
- Manual approval flow for any email actions
- Parked: Kevin Webb/Superorganism email (chase reminder set for Feb 21)

## Major Developments (Feb 16)
- OpenAI acqui-hired Peter Steinberger. OpenClaw → foundation governance, OpenAI sponsor. Blog: steipete.me/posts/2026/openclaw
- Calacanis doing live $250K termsheets for OpenClaw builders on TWiST. YC deal (7.5%).
- Mark: Sam Clifton is junior associate, not decision maker. Pitch targets senior partners.
- Mark: "everyone of note in SV is pilled on OpenClaw"
- All Causal pitch docs updated: AMMO.md, DEAL-SHEET.md, PITCH-NARRATIVE.md, DESIGN.md
- De-anchored from Sam. Generic reinsurer framing. OpenAI/foundation/VC signals added.
- Mark forwarded full Feb 13-14 thread (17 messages). Sam pub intel logged. Context death patched.

## Sam Clifton — context recovered from session logs
- Full pub conversation found in session a18c84e6 (Feb 13, 18:55-19:19 GMT)
- Sam typed directly into Mark's Telegram at Blue Anchor Hammersmith
- Key moments: matplotlib story, 40K instances, hallucinated restaurant recs, leaked $300K file, "fancy Apache Airflow" dig, Sam's CLN photo (using Sonnet 4.5 at pub), philosophising about "what I are"
- Sam's post-beers feedback (logged from Mark's forward): two-tier positioning, "Linux 1994" analogy, underwriters don't know OpenClaw/Vercel, defined limits not enterprise cyber
- Logged to memory/2026-02-13.md and vault/people/sam-clifton.md

## New AMMO candidate — Claude Cowork file deletion (Feb 16)
- Nick Davidov LinkedIn post: Claude Cowork asked to organize wife's desktop, accidentally deleted 15 years of family photos via terminal
- Not in trash (terminal rm), iCloud already synced empty state, no Time Machine
- Recovered only via 30-day iCloud grace feature — luck, not design
- His quote: "don't let Claude Cowork (or especially things like OpenClaw) into your actual file system"
- Textbook Tier 1 claim scenario: human approved action, agent exceeded scope, irreversible damage
- Not yet added to AMMO.md — awaiting Mark's confirmation

## Vuln scan — 2 new criticals (Feb 16)
- CVE-2026-25157: command injection, unpatched
- Hudson Rock infostealer campaign: actively targeting OpenClaw configs, stealing API keys, live as of 3am UTC
- 3 unpatched criticals total in tracker

## Trading signals — watch only
- Morning brief still outputting weather signals but no trading until PolyWeatherBot built
- Asked Mark: kill signal output or add disclaimer? No answer yet
- Polymarket state unchanged: $6.56 portfolio, $0.06 cash, -$16.22 all-time, 0 positions

## Docs sent to Mark
- All 4 Causal docs sent as Telegram file attachments (not inline) for Typora editing
- Also emailed via agentmail (inline, less useful)

## Session wrap (Feb 16, 14:25)
- Upgraded OpenClaw 2026.2.14 → 2026.2.15 (security hardening, nested sub-agents, cron webhooks)
- Switched model: Opus 4.6 → Opus 4.5
- Fixed context window: removed explicit 1M override, now uses model-native 200K
- Causal docs emailed + Telegram'd to Mark (DEAL-SHEET, PITCH-NARRATIVE, DESIGN, AMMO)
- Nick Davidov Claude Cowork incident noted (15 years photos deleted) — candidate for AMMO
- Mark's PR #17345 still pending — Peter busy with OpenAI acqui-hire
- streamMode: "partial" already configured — we have the new streaming feature

## Key state for next session
- Model: Opus 4.5, 200K context
- OpenClaw: 2026.2.15
- Causal docs updated with OpenAI/foundation news, de-anchored from Sam
- Trading: watch-only, no execution until PolyWeatherBot built
- Email triage: OFF
- Next actions: Mark reviewing Causal docs, Claude Code brief awaiting his notes
