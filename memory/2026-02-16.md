# 2026-02-16 — Monday Session Log

## Grok/xAI skill installed
- `clawhub install grok` — xAI search skill (web + X/Twitter) by @cstanley
- Needs xAI API key from console.x.ai — not yet provided
- xAI ToS strict: no public key sharing, no public forums, audit logs. Key in Keychain only.
- Replaces Twitter API dependency entirely

## PolyWeatherBot — Hummingbot analysis
- Sub-agent cloned hummingbot/hummingbot, wrote 50KB analysis
- Decision: don't fork (135K lines, 80% irrelevant). Steal 5 patterns, build ~3K-line bot
- Patterns: connector abstraction, ClientOrderTracker, triple barrier risk, controller/executor, P/L formula
- Claude Code brief: `projects/hummingbot-analysis/CLAUDE-CODE-BRIEF.md`
- Emailed to Mark, awaiting notes before CC handoff
- Supersedes both Position Manager spec and reconciliation rewrite
- KEY RULE: system must continuously poll Polymarket APIs for live portfolio state. Local must match remote at all times. Not a one-off reconcile, not a hardcoded number.

## AMMO.md updated with 4 new entries
- Adam Kling/CrewAI: 100% enterprises expanding agents, 95% failed in production. Goldman zero-trust approach.
- Mark's PR #17345 to OpenClaw — core contributor credibility for Sam pitch
- Claw Score external audit framework
- Hummingbot architecture reference

## Mark's OpenClaw PR #17345
- "Runner memory rebuild: token budgeting, recall caps, incremental summary state"
- 7 commits covering Phases 1, 2, 3, 5 of memory kernel rebuild
- Greptile 4/5 confidence
- Posted reply under @levelsio tweet (322K views) about persistent memory — perfect placement
- Robert Pop (@robipop22) has competing 3-layer approach (SQLite+Qdrant+Postgres graph) — overengineered userspace workaround vs Mark's infrastructure fix

## Autonomous loop fixed
- Was spamming Mark about Kevin Webb email despite being told to park it — loop kept re-alerting
- Patched: email checking OFF, no re-alerting on acknowledged items, added commitment deadline check
- Email triage stays OFF until Mark explicitly re-enables

## Morning brief patched
- Was reading stale data, reporting fake paper trader win rates
- Updated prompt: reads COMMITMENTS + yesterday's memory, flags paper trader as fiction, skips email, checks PR merge status

## Instructions to remember
- Email triage OFF until Mark says otherwise
- Don't notify about agentmail inbox
- Manual approval flow for any email actions
- Parked: Kevin Webb/Superorganism email (chase reminder set for Feb 21)
