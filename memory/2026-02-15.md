# 2026-02-15 — Sunday Session Log

## Email-as-chief-of-staff workflow established
- Mark forwarded Superorganism email to clawdine@agentmail.to — first real chief-of-staff email triage
- Kevin Webb (Founding Partner, Superorganism) replied Feb 14: "back in touch next week"
- Chase reminder set for Fri Feb 21 9am if no reply
- Mark's follow-up noted T1 at $520K/$500K target, Rio Tinto Phase 2 in SoW ($601K+$250K), cameras shipped to Bangladesh
- Workflow: Mark forwards emails needing action → Clawdine reads AgentMail, extracts actions, tracks deadlines

## Experiment: forwarded trading advice
- Mark forwarded generic trading discipline advice as a test — I treated it as his words and agreed with it
- Lesson: should flag forwarded/third-party content and evaluate critically, not just validate

## Codex building OpenClaw memory rebuild
- GPT-5.3-Codex analyzing OpenClaw's context/memory management — 7-phase rebuild plan
- Key finding: no per-turn retrieval budget planner in runner (confirms our context bloat diagnosis)
- Phase 1: token-budget context planner replacing limitHistoryTurns

## AgentMail API notes
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (not x-api-key)
- List messages: `GET /v0/inboxes/{inbox}/messages`
- Get message: `GET /v0/inboxes/{inbox}/messages/{url-encoded-message-id}`
- Body in `text` field, not `body_text`
- 95 messages in inbox now (mostly sent BTC reports)

## Config patch applied
- Gateway restarted cleanly from config.patch earlier in session

## Grok/xAI skill installed
- `clawhub install grok` — xAI Grok search skill by Christopher Stanley (@cstanley)
- Enables X/Twitter search + web search via xAI Responses API (`/v1/responses`)
- No Twitter API keys needed — goes through Grok as intermediary, safe from X bot bans
- Needs xAI API key from https://console.x.ai/ — Mark aware, not yet provided
- Stored in skills/grok/. Replaces Twitter API dependency.
- xAI ToS strict: no public key sharing, no public forums, rate limits, audit logs. Key revoked on abuse.

## PolyWeatherBot — Hummingbot analysis complete
- Cloned hummingbot/hummingbot (shallow) to projects/hummingbot-analysis/
- Sub-agent wrote 50KB analysis: `projects/hummingbot-analysis/ANALYSIS.md`
- Decision: DON'T fork Hummingbot (135K lines, 80% irrelevant). Steal 5 patterns, build ~3K-line focused bot.
- Patterns: exchange connector abstraction, ClientOrderTracker, triple barrier risk, V2 controller/executor split, PerformanceMetrics P/L
- Claude Code brief written: `projects/hummingbot-analysis/CLAUDE-CODE-BRIEF.md`
- Emailed analysis to Mark (Gmail). Awaiting his notes before CC handoff.
- This SUPERSEDES both Position Manager spec and reconciliation rewrite — unified system.
- AgentMail send endpoint: `POST /v0/inboxes/{inbox}/messages/send`

## Email workflow clarified
- Manual approval flow confirmed. I read, summarise, extract actions/deadlines. Mark approves before anything goes out.

## Resend email service noted
- Zeno Rocha (@zenorocha) built Resend integration for OpenClaw
- steipete got Resend to disable bot detection for OC agents
- We don't need it now (AgentMail covers us) but useful if we need volume sending later
