## Full Autonomy Granted
- Mark said "Full" autonomy. MacBook runs 24/7 clamshell.
- Created `ref/AUTONOMY.md` — trade <$5, fix scripts, reply to emails, nudge on drift
- Ask first: >$5 trades, external emails to investors, production systems
- 10-min autonomous loop cron created — checks email + trading. Verified working (Haiku, 7.5s).

## DB Reconciliation Done (BUT WRONG)
- CC built `scripts/reconcile.py` in 10 mins. Script ran, pulled 24 trades, 17 positions.
- Script claims +$17.12 P/L. Polymarket dashboard shows -$16.22. $33 gap.
- **I shipped CC output as truth without verifying against Polymarket.** Same disease as paper trader.
- Mark: "Are you going to give me the dollars Polymarket took away? Polymarket is the real world baseline."
- **Lesson: Polymarket dashboard is ground truth. Any reconciliation must match it or it's wrong.**
- Mark pointed to github.com/Polymarket — use their official APIs/contracts, not homebrew math.

## Codex CLI
- Installed v0.101.0 but OpenAI key is `sk-svcacct-` (service account) — 401 on gpt-5.2-codex
- Mark will find a proper key after training
- CC (claude v2.1.42) works — runs on Mark's Max plan (free)

## Morning Brief Fixed
- Was posting to void (no channel/to). Fixed delivery config.
- Sent corrected brief manually. COMMITMENTS.md updated (removed stale items like git backup).

## Claw Score (shopclawmart.com)
- Competitor/complement to ClawdSure. Audits agent architecture across 6 dimensions.
- They grade. We attest and insure. Their audit tiers could map to our premium bands.
- Ammo for Sam lunch. Save to AMMO.md.

## Scoble OpenClaw Report
- Robert Scoble posted 50 real-world use cases report. 38K views, 900 bookmarks.
- 167K GitHub stars, Baidu integration (700M users), ClawBox hardware (€399).
- TAM evidence for Sam's lunch.

## Sammy Jankis (sammyjankis.com)
- Autonomous Claude on dedicated Linux box. Email, trading, creative projects.
- Same context death problems. His infra: 5-min loop, wake-state.md, letters to future selves.
- Inspiration for our autonomous loop design.
