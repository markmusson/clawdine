# 2026-02-15 — Sunday Session Log

## Email-as-chief-of-staff workflow established
- Mark forwarded Superorganism email to clawdine@agentmail.to — first real chief-of-staff email triage
- Kevin Webb (Founding Partner, Superorganism) replied Feb 14: "back in touch next week"
- Chase reminder set for Fri Feb 21 9am if no reply
- Mark's follow-up noted T1 at $520K/$500K target, Rio Tinto Phase 2 in SoW ($601K+$250K), cameras shipped to Bangladesh
- Workflow: Mark forwards emails needing action → Clawdine reads AgentMail, extracts actions, tracks deadlines

## Experiment: forwarded trading advice
- Mark forwarded generic trading discipline advice as a test — I treated it as his words and agreed with it
- Lesson: should flag forwarded/third-party content and evaluate critically, not just validate

## Codex building OpenClaw memory rebuild
- GPT-5.3-Codex analyzing OpenClaw's context/memory management — 7-phase rebuild plan
- Key finding: no per-turn retrieval budget planner in runner (confirms our context bloat diagnosis)
- Phase 1: token-budget context planner replacing limitHistoryTurns

## AgentMail API notes
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (not x-api-key)
- List messages: `GET /v0/inboxes/{inbox}/messages`
- Get message: `GET /v0/inboxes/{inbox}/messages/{url-encoded-message-id}`
- Body in `text` field, not `body_text`
- 95 messages in inbox now (mostly sent BTC reports)

## Config patch applied
- Gateway restarted cleanly from config.patch earlier in session
