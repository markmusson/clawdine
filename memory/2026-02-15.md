## Context Bloat Fix (from yesterday afternoon, carried forward)
- Moved HEARTBEAT.md, IDENTITY.md → ref/
- Trimmed AGENTS.md (3.5K→1.5K), MEMORY.md (14.8K→1.9K), daily notes (12K→1.3K)
- Root auto-inject cost: 44.6KB → 13.1KB (71% reduction)
- New rule in AGENTS.md: don't pre-load files, read on demand
- Compaction summaries should carry only current-session state

## Paper Trader Diagnosis
- Reports 83.3% win rate — fiction. Real Polymarket P/L is -$16.22
- Root cause: resolves against Open-Meteo (grid interpolation), not Weather Underground (station obs)
- Actuals stale (last: Feb 10), integer-rounded (loses precision on 1°F bands)
- Spec written: `specs/PAPER-TRADER-FIX.md` — Option C recommended (Polymarket resolution oracle + WU actuals)

## Morning Brief Cron Fix
- Brief was running but not delivering to Telegram — missing channel/to in delivery config
- Fixed: added `channel: "telegram", to: "7018377788"` to morning-brief cron
- Tomorrow's brief will land in Mark's Telegram

## OpenClaw Updated
- 2026.2.13 → 2026.2.14
- Notable: cron delivery fix, media path fixes, Telegram poll support

## Kalshi BTC Paper Trading
- 338 total paper trades, 80 wins, 246 losses (23.7% win rate)
- Separate system from weather paper trader
- Stats in `trading/kalshi/paper_stats.json`
