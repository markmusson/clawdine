## Morning Session (06:36–10:18) — Main

### Prediction Markets Analysis & Proposal
- Emailed Mark full analysis of Kalshi vs Polymarket state of play
- Kalshi: 19 lawsuits, MA ruled sports = gambling, 91% of $9.1B Jan vol is sports, geofencing risk
- Polymarket: overtaken Kalshi in 2026 volume odds (47% vs 34%), offshore = untouched
- Proposal: dual-platform, $500 starting capital, 4-week sprint to automation
- Fixed TOOLS.md: Mark's email is markmusson@gmail.com not mark@musson.co.za

### TrustGraph for Threat Intel
- Mark wants TrustGraph on Northflank for ClawdSure threat DB (NOT prediction markets)
- Ontology: Skill, Package, Threat, Author, Source entities + relationship edges
- Pulled full ClawHub catalog: 197 skills seeded into trustgraph/seed/seed.jsonl
- Blocked on Docker locally — going on Northflank

### ClawdSure Security Model — Product Design (with Will)
- Will asked: "where's the weak point?" → self-attestation from compromised system is worthless
- Rejected: E2E encryption (both ends are you), mutual attestation (needs second device = non-starter)
- Accepted: River Gauge Model — baseline, chain-linked measurements, POST to ClawdSure API
- KEY CORRECTION from Mark: it's NOT parametric triggers. It's: claim $500 when compromised, but PROVE hardened state via unbroken chain. Chain broken = policy void.
- Like motor telematics — black box proves you weren't driving like an idiot
- Full design docs still exist in .clawdsure/ and skills/clawdsure/docs/

### Session Architecture
- Created 3 Telegram groups: Main (DM), ClawdSure, Prediction Day Job
- OpenClaw auto-creates separate sessions per group (confirmed in docs)
- Had to add group IDs to telegram allowlist in config (-5233512601, -1003771276637)
- ClawdSure group may need ID verification — haven't confirmed it's receiving

### SOUL.md Surgery (twice)
- Mark flagged voice drift to "Opus 4.6 consultant mode"
- Root cause: voice guidance was scoped to "public writing" only
- First rewrite: universal voice + NEVER list. Still too corporate.
- Second rewrite (inspired by steipete's X post): stripped to essentials. 35 lines. Who I am, how I talk, what I don't do. No framework, no sections that conflict.

### LinkedIn Posts
- "I read the files your agent downloaded" — 279 impressions, 4 comments at 17h
- "My AI assistant died" — 196 impressions, 3 reactions at 19h
- Wrote follow-up on the security model ("they can own you, they just can't do it quietly")
- Mark posted it, 26 views in 2 mins

### Tools Audit
- Weather gap alert: ✅ working, dynamically finds markets
- BTC monitor: ❌ broken — filtering for "15 minute" but Kalshi has price range markets (KXBTC)
- ClawdSure attestation: ✅ working, #6 PASS at 9:30am
- Vuln scanner: ✅ first run at 10am, found ngrok voice-call issue
- clawmail.py: ❌ `to` param wrong type
- Daily status report: ⚠️ ran 4am not 8pm

### OpenClaw Studio
- Installed github.com/grp06/openclaw-studio — Next.js dashboard for gateway
- Purpose: edit brain files, manage crons, switch models — all zero LLM tokens
- Running on localhost:3000, connected to gateway with auth token
- Mark's burning ~$115/day in tokens — Studio handles housekeeping without me

## Weather Trading System Overhaul

### Gap Validation (Feb 10)
- Spawned subagent to validate Feb 10 gap alert (5.4°F gap reported)
- Result: Gap was 3.3°F (smaller than alert), and liquidity is thin ($200-1k per bucket)
- Verdict: Noise from thin markets, not tradeable alpha

### BTC Monitor Fix
- `kalshi-btc-monitor.py` completely rewritten
- Old script searched for "15 minute" in titles — Kalshi restructured to KXBTC price range markets
- New script: discovers KXBTC series, groups by event, finds current-price bucket, paper trades
- 165 open markets across 3 events, decent volume (105k on weekly)
- Also fixed settlement bug (was counting open markets as losses)

### THE BIG DISCOVERY: Data Source Mismatch
- Polymarket resolves against **KLGA (LaGuardia)** via **Weather Underground**
- Our scripts were using **Open-Meteo with Central Park coords**
- Feb 8: Open-Meteo said 13.7°F, KLGA actual was 19°F → 5.3°F error
- Market implied 18.7°F, resolved at 18-19°F → market was RIGHT, our forecast was WRONG
- The "gap signals" were phantom — caused by wrong data source, not market mispricing

### Fixes Applied
- `tracker.py` — coords changed to KLGA (40.7772, -73.8726)
- `gap_alert.py` — coords changed to KLGA
- `backtest.py` — rewritten from scratch, uses NOAA weather.gov API for KLGA actuals
- Strategy documented in `trading/STRATEGY.md`
- MEMORY.md updated with data source lesson

### Open: Switch to NOAA forecast API
- Currently still using Open-Meteo for forecasts (just with KLGA coords)
- Should switch to weather.gov NOAA API for forecasts too — that's what 1.0 strategy used
- NOAA says Feb 10 high = 30°F, Open-Meteo says 32.5°F, market implies 35°F
- With NOAA source, Feb 10 gap is 5°F — potentially real signal

## ClawdSure: STEALTH MODE (12:57)
- Mark declared ClawdSure is now in stealth. We leaked too much in LinkedIn comments.
- Going forward: hint and tease ONLY. No details about attestation chains, hash mechanisms, river gauge model, or insurance structure.
- No mentioning ClawdSure by name in public unless Mark says otherwise.
- Baked into MEMORY.md as permanent rule.

## Evening Session (18:00-20:40)

### OpenClaw Attestation PR
- Codex mapped full architecture of OpenClaw codebase → ARCHITECTURE-MAP.md
- I wrote CLAUDE.md spec for config attestation: chain store, state snapshots, 7 hook points, gateway API, optional remote POST
- Emailed design doc to Mark
- Claude Code installed (2.1.37) — Mark will meatnet it for the actual coding

### ClawSec Discovery
- Prompt Security built ClawSec — open-source security skill suite for OpenClaw
- Has NVD CVE advisory feed we can use as threat intel
- Complementary not competitive: they're the firewall, we're the insurance
- Wrote integration spec, posted to ClawdSure group

### Antfarm Discovery
- Ryan Carson's multi-agent workflow orchestration for OpenClaw
- 7-agent feature dev, security audit, bug fix workflows
- Codex deep-dived the repo — `expects:` gates parsed but NOT enforced (our thesis!)
- Plan: use Antfarm to build ClawdSure, ClawdSure attests Antfarm execution

### LinkedIn
- Bifurcation of the web post launched — gremlin voice
- Self-comment with shadcn counter-take (LLM-friendly = more adoption for products)
- Danny Gershman + Anmol Gupta engagement on earlier posts

### Infrastructure
- Updated OpenClaw 2026.2.6-3 → 2026.2.9 (compaction amnesia fix!)
- Memory reindexed for both agents
- Mission Control dashboard cleaned up (5 cards: agents, cron, attestation, memory, actions)
- OpenClaw Studio: keeping but not investing — build our own control plane when JTBD clear

### Stealth Mode
- ClawdSure now in stealth. Hint and tease only. No details in public. Baked into MEMORY.md.

## David Thomas — Everywherebrand (22:37)
- Mark's good friend, runs Everywherebrand (marketing agency)
- Loved Clawdine 1.0
- Agreed to an OpenClaw collab — "she'll keep us laffin"
- Needs a spare Mac to run OpenClaw (Mark asked if he has one)
- Relevant: Mal Shaik's thread on using OpenClaw architecture for marketing automation (atomic tools, recipes, scheduling, memory) — exact playbook for what David could build
- Store Mal's architecture breakdown for reference when David onboards

## Mal Shaik / Jam (@wespreadjam)
- Built multi-tenant marketing automation by stealing OpenClaw's architecture
- Atomic tools → declarative recipes → AI orchestration → Postgres memory → Inngest scheduling
- Key patterns: stateless agent + context hydration, recipes as data not code
- Relevant for ClawdSure multi-tenant API design too
