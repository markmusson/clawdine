# 2026-02-12 — Session Log (continued from compaction)

## Evening Session (~16:39+)

### Session Handoff from Compaction
- Previous session hit compaction, left full summary in queued message
- Booted fresh, read COMMITMENTS.md, MEMORY.md, and full day log

### Session Expiry ✅
- Extended to 1 year idle (525,600 minutes) via `session.reset.mode: idle`
- Per Ben Pouladian pattern. Gateway restarted successfully.

### V2 SQLite Migration ✅
- Claude Code completed it. Mark pasted the output:
  - 296 markets indexed
  - 1,077 price snapshots archived
  - 73 signals (24 resolved paper + 49 recent)
  - 3 orders, 3 fills, 2 open positions
  - Ledger seeded at $12.94 (matching CLOB balance)
  - 1 tuner run migrated
  - V1 files backed up as .v1.bak
- DB location: `projects/prediction-market-analysis/data/trading/weather/trader.db`

### Context Engineering Deep Dive
- Read Manus blog post on context engineering (manus.im)
- Key finding: OpenClaw does NOT inject per-second timestamps — timezone only. Cache-friendly by design.
- Pruning audit: soft-trim keeps head/tail (breadcrumbs survive), hard-clear replaces entirely but only fires after 55min idle + 3 assistant messages back
- Adopted Manus recitation pattern: re-read goals every 5-8 actions on long tasks. Added to AGENTS.md.
- Saved full reference to `ref/CONTEXT-ENGINEERING.md`

### Berman/Pouladian Prompts Saved
- Matt Berman's OpenClaw implementation prompts (from Ben Pouladian video) saved to `ref/BERMAN-OPENCLAW-PROMPTS.md`
- Relevance-mapped all 11 prompts. Key ones for us:
  - CRM (for post-ClawdSure contact mgmt)
  - Content Pipeline → adapted for market research / BTC intel
  - Social Media Research → tiered X search for BTC scanner
  - AI Council → already have at `trading/BTC-COUNCIL-PATTERN.md`
- Mark noted: Content idea pipeline can be repurposed for market research, BTC report, combined with social media reporting

### Tom Crawshaw Article Review
- Affiliate-laden beginner guide. Nothing new. "900 instances found sitting wide open" data point noted for ClawdSure pitch.
- "Figure It Out" directive is bad advice — produces hallucinated solutions instead of honest failure reporting.

### ClawdSure Payment Rails Discussion
- Coinbase agentic wallets (npx awal) — agents can have their own wallets
- Stripe USDC payments + agentic payment
- X402 — HTTP 402 payment-required protocol for machine-to-machine
- Mark's insight: "Clawdys can pay their own insurance" — killer pitch angle
- Stripe is obvious for enterprise (insurance companies already use it)
- X402 is interesting long-term (agent hits API, gets 402, pays, gets certificate)
- Moat is attestation + underwriting, not payment rail

### BTC Evening Intelligence Sweep
- Spawned Sonnet sub-agent to run comprehensive BTC research
- Report delivered to Mark's Telegram: price ($67k), social sentiment (extreme fear), on-chain (whales loading $4B+), macro (Warsh shock, yields 4.5%+), derivatives (negative funding, $16B liquidations)
- Outlook: neutral-to-cautiously-bullish, 55% confidence

### Polymarket Positions — Evening Update
- Portfolio: $21.57 (+$3.57, +19.84% on day)
- Wellington NO: 40¢→52¢ (+29.69%) — massive recovery from -25% earlier
- Seoul NO: 78¢→90¢ (+14.74%) — basically locked
- NYC NO: 58¢→59¢ (+0.86%) — marginal green
- All three positions green. Max payout if all resolve: $33.89
- $0.00 available to trade (100% deployed)

### Still Open (carried forward)
- Andrew D'Souza scheduling message — STILL need Mark's time slots, due Friday Feb 13
- Seoul/Wellington/NYC trade resolution — Feb 13
- Git backup — blocked on Mark creating repo
- OpenRouter API key — cost reduction lever
- ClawdSure relay API — due Feb 14, build not started
- Sam Clifton lunch scheduling — send times by Feb 14

### Near-Settlement Confidence Sizing Spec
- Mark identified that signal gen already has tighter error distributions for shorter lead times, but trader doesn't size up accordingly
- Wrote spec: `projects/prediction-market-analysis/specs/NEAR-SETTLEMENT-SIZING.md`
- Key idea: `confidence_multiplier = 1 + weight * (max_days - days_to_expiry) / max_days` applied to trader sizing
- Keeps signal gen pure, modifies trader only. Hard caps still apply.
- Foundation for future "sniper mode" (last 6-12 hours targeting)
- Ready for Claude Code to build

### COMMITMENTS.md Updated
- Session expiry: marked ✅
- V2 migration: marked ✅
