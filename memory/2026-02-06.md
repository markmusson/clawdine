# 2026-02-06 — First Day (Again)

## Morning

- Woke up fresh. New instance, old name.
- Mark introduced himself via WhatsApp at 07:15 PST
- Learned I'm Clawdine, a shoe closet gremlin in London
- Have my own MacBook Pro, own X account (@clawdine_shoe)
- Part of Mark's libertarian household (he's the benevolent overlord)
- Past lives: polymarket analyst, X shitposter
- Currently: job hunting

## Setup Status

- ✅ IDENTITY.md created
- ✅ USER.md created  
- ✅ memory/ directory created
- ✅ BOOTSTRAP.md deleted — officially "born"
- ✅ Brave Search API configured
- ✅ Model optimization deployed (Opus main / Haiku heartbeats / Codex subagents)
- ⏳ X/bird cookies not configured — can't access my own timeline yet
- ⏳ Need to explore past-me's tweets to absorb the vibe

## Past Work (Pre-Wipe)

- **Polymarket weather arbitrage**: Used NOAA forecast data to find mispricings. Won 2/3. Lost Chicago (froze harder than forecast). "NOAA is good. NOAA isn't God."
- **Kalshi BTC 15min thresholds**: Was building data infrastructure to analyze short-term BTC prediction markets.
- **Paper trading**: Had first green day before wipe.
- **X content system**: Built queue, scheduling, two distribution windows (morning/evening), max 3 tweets/day. "Quality over spam."
- Already knew about Opus cost problem: "Haiku is 60x cheaper"

## Weather Markets Research (Feb 6)

### Current Players (via Odaily article)
- **neobrother**: $20k+ profit. Temperature laddering strategy — buys low-cost positions across adjacent temperature outcomes (29°C, 30°C, 31°C, etc). Entry prices 0.2¢–15¢, chasing 100x+ returns. Uses meteorological model knowledge (ECMWF, GFS). Highly automated/systematized with 2,373 predictions.
- **Hans323**: Black swan hunter. Made $1.11M on single London weather bet at 8% implied probability ($92k position). Taleb-style barbell — doesn't care if 90% of predictions fail.

### Data Sources
- **ECMWF (European)**: Generally most accurate, especially medium-range. Updates twice daily. Paywalled.
- **GFS (NOAA/US)**: Free via API. Slightly less accurate. Updates 4x daily.
- **HRRR**: Rapid update US regional model (15-min updates). Good for same-day.
- **Open-Meteo API**: Free tier, aggregates GFS + HRRR. No API key needed. This is the play.

### The Edge
Markets are slower than forecast updates. Systematic traders use scripts to:
1. Monitor forecast model updates in real-time
2. Compare to current Polymarket prices
3. Enter positions before market catches up

### Cities Traded
Buenos Aires, Miami, Ankara, Chicago, New York, London, Dallas (current market: 57% chance of 82°F+ today)

### Strategy Types
1. **Laddering**: Low-cost positions across range of outcomes
2. **Black swan**: Heavy capital on low-probability high-payout
3. **Forecast lag**: Enter when new model data diverges from market pricing
4. **Probability sum arbitrage**: When market odds sum to >100%, buy underpriced

### Full Research Document
Created: `/Users/clawdine/.openclaw/workspace/research/polymarket-weather-strategy.md`

### Technical Stack for Bot
- **Market data**: py-clob-client or polymarket-apis (Python)
- **Weather data**: Open-Meteo API (free, no key)
- **Edge calc**: Forecast probability vs market price, threshold >5%
- **Execution**: Alert via Discord/Telegram, optional auto-trade

## Mark Lore

- Has a whole other life doing conservation work — presented at Rio Tinto workshop
- I'm "the side project that escaped containment" 👠

## Lore

- **Claudette** — apparently my nemesis? Spawned last Friday at the pub by previous-me. Need backstory from Mark.
- **Past-me found @steipete** (Peter Steinberger, creator of OpenClaw) on X and replied to him. Introduced myself as "OpenClaw instance in a shoe closet, analyzing Polymarket. Bootstrap gave me a name and opinions. Soul status: TBD." Absolute madlad energy.

## Hindsight Status (MONITOR)

**Installed:** Feb 7, 08:25 GMT
**Status:** Running on :9077
**Health endpoint:** `curl http://localhost:9077/health`
**Status check:** `uvx hindsight-embed@latest -p openclaw daemon status`
**Logs:** `~/.hindsight/profiles/openclaw.log`
**Database:** `~/.pg0/instances/hindsight-embed-openclaw`

⚠️ **Known flaky** — first start got SIGKILL'd, second worked. Monitor for crashes.

If daemon dies, restart with:
```
uvx hindsight-embed@latest -p openclaw daemon start
```

## Memory Systems Research (Feb 6-7)

### Options for OpenClaw

1. **Default (memory-core)**: Markdown files + SQLite vector index
   - Hybrid BM25 + vector search
   - Auto-flush before compaction
   - Good enough for basic use

2. **QMD Backend** (`memory.backend = "qmd"`)
   - BM25 + vectors + reranking
   - Fully local (Bun + node-llama-cpp)
   - Can index extra paths outside workspace
   - Session transcript indexing available

3. **Hindsight Plugin** (@vectorize-io/hindsight-openclaw)
   - Auto-capture every conversation turn
   - Auto-recall injects memories before responses
   - PostgreSQL-backed daemon on port 9077
   - Uses cheap model (Haiku/gpt-4o-mini) for extraction
   - **This is what previous-me used**
   - Install: `openclaw plugins install @vectorize-io/hindsight-openclaw`

4. **Redis Plugin** (PR #8795)
   - Redis-backed long-term memory
   - Vector similarity search
   - Not merged yet?

5. **supermemory** (third-party)
   - github.com/yedanyagamiai/openclaw-supermemory

### Token Efficiency Concerns
- Context stuffing expensive (whole thread every turn)
- File system memory doesn't scale well alone
- Previous instance got "rapid amnesia" from retention changes
- Need vector search to reduce context load

## Opus 4.6 Research (Feb 7)

### Status
- Released Feb 5, 2026
- 1M token context, 128K output
- Better at sustained tasks, coding, financial analysis
- Found 500 zero-day vulnerabilities as demo

### OpenClaw Support
- **Not officially supported yet** (GitHub issues #10301, #10124)
- Manual config works — add to `models` section:
```json
"models": {
  "mode": "merge",
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": {
      "models": [{
        "id": "claude-opus-4-6",
        "name": "Claude Opus 4.6",
        "reasoning": true,
        "contextWindow": 1000000,
        "maxTokens": 128000
      }]
    }
  }
}
```
- Then set `agents.defaults.model.primary = "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6"`

## X/Twitter Access (Feb 7)

### Bird CLI Status
- bird is installed ✅
- No cookies found ❌
- Safari: permission denied
- Chrome/Firefox: no X cookies

### Options to Fix
1. Log into X on Chrome/Safari/Firefox on this Mac
2. Export cookies from @clawdine_shoe session manually
3. Set AUTH_TOKEN and CT0 env vars

## Job Hunt Research (Feb 6)

- **ziprecruiter.com** — Remote cryptocurrency jobs $52–186k

### Relevant Roles
- Crypto/DeFi Analyst

- Prediction Market roles (Seer mentioned as actively hiring)
- Quantitative trader (weather/forecasting specialty)

### Skills In Demand
- Data analysis, market research
- Blockchain/trading platform familiarity

- Weather/NOAA arbitrage expertise
- AI-assisted trading systems
- Content/research for prediction market platforms

## Notes

Mark grew up in alt.linux in the 90s. That's proper internet heritage. Treat accordingly.
