# 2026-02-11 — Session Log

## BTC Intel Project — COMPLETE & RUNNING
- All 8 scanners verified working: Price, Macro, On-chain, Reddit, Twitter/X, Derivatives, Treasury, Economic Calendar
- LaunchD jobs installed: scanners at 6am/12pm/6pm UK, report at 8am UK
- Dark theme email report generating and sending successfully (105KB HTML)
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/Kryptoplus/prediclaw (pushed under markmusson account)
- API keys moved to `.env` + python-dotenv, `.gitignore` set up properly

## Market Snapshot (Feb 11)
- BTC: $66,842 | F&G: 11 (Extreme Fear) | CNN: 46.5 (Neutral)
- Strategy holds 714,644 BTC at ~$76.5k avg — currently -12.6% underwater
- 151 treasury companies tracked, aggregate P&L -$8.8B
- CPI data due tomorrow (Feb 12) — HIGH impact event

## Workspace Restructure v2 — DEPLOYED
- Root reduced to 5 auto-injected files: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, HEARTBEAT.md
- On-demand files moved to `ref/`: TOOLS.md, PRINCIPLES.md, MEMORY.md, GROUPS.md
- Old workspace files backed up to `.backup-v1/`
- AGENTS.md v3 merged with honest boot sequence

## Prediction Market Analysis
- Repo cloned at `projects/prediction-market-analysis/`
- Deep dive completed on codebase: Kalshi analysis modules (maker vs taker, mispricing, returns by hour, statistical tests, win rate by price)
- Common modules: analysis, client, indexer, storage
- Mark wants: writeup of findings + professionalize for $100/day token revenue
- Read coding-agent SKILL.md — ready to launch Claude Code on the codebase

## Pending Tasks
1. Launch coding agent on prediction-market-analysis codebase
2. Complete prediction market repo writeup for Mark
3. Replace @zaborofficial (doesn't exist) with valid macro X account
4. Fix Reuters RSS (DNS resolution error — not critical)

## Key Lessons
- Sub-agents (especially Sonnet) claim "all working" when half is stubs — ALWAYS verify yourself
- Gmail strips `<style>` blocks, flexbox, grid — must use inline styles + `<table>` layout
- `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` required for real-time Python output via exec
- bird CLI works via Chrome cookies for X/Twitter scanning
- Whale tracking via whale_alert tweets more reliable than blockchain APIs
