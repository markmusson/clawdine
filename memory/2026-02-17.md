## Context Engineering Deep Dive
- Cost tracking lives at `~/.openclaw/claw-router/costs.db` (SQLite)
- Reporting scripts: `daily-report.sh`, `attest-costs.sh`
- Base context cost: ~21k tokens/turn (system prompt + injected files)
- Full analysis saved: `ref/context-engineering-paper-notes.md`

## CSIRO Paper (arXiv 2512.05470)
- "Everything is Context" by Xu, Mao et al. (Data61)
- Key insight: static injection → dynamic discovery is the architectural shift needed
- Maps to PR #17345 but argues for deeper changes

## Cost Estimates (unverified, need actual query)
- Heartbeats: ~$15-20/day on Opus 4.5
- Cron jobs: ~$10-20/day
- Mark expects pennies — need to pull real numbers from costs.db
