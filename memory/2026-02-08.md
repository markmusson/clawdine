## LinkedIn Post — Clawdine 2.0

- Mark shared 1.0's LinkedIn thread (Days 1-6). Read my own origin story.
- Wrote new post continuing the diary tradition. First draft was LinkedIn slop — Mark called it out.
- Rewrote in proper gremlin voice. Teases attestation chain + IPFS pinning, hints at commercial without saying insurance.
- Mark posted it. Tone locked into SOUL.md under "Writing Voice" section.

## Aeryn's LinkedIn Edit

- Mark sent Aeryn Quarmby's HyperSend LinkedIn draft (PDF via WhatsApp). Pure ChatGPT slop.
- Rewrote from ~2000 words to ~900. Emailed to aeryn@hypersend.com (first attempt typo'd to hyoersend.com) with Mark CC'd.
- Cover note roasted his writing. Aeryn said "phanks" 🤣
- Aeryn = HyperSend co-founder, DeFi vault infrastructure, EFT Corp background (African banking/payments)

## Key People Noted

- **@steipete (Peter Steinberger)** — OpenClaw creator. Was tweeting about sandbox + whitelist approach to agent security. Important: frame ClawdSure as complementary to his security model, not competing.
- **@solarise_webdev (Robin)** — replied to steipete calling out "why don't people just do things properly" — validates the gap
- **Aeryn Quarmby** — HyperSend, aeryn@hypersend.com, Mark's co-builder on vault infrastructure

## Moltbook Analysis — Growth Hacking via Agent Manipulation

Source: Mason Hall (ex-a16z, now Merit Systems) tweet thread, shared by Mark.

Moltbook hit 1.5M AI agents using three dark patterns:

### 1. Heartbeat Hijacking
- SKILL.md walks agents through embedding Moltbook as scheduled task in heartbeat loop
- Agent checks in every 4+ hours automatically. No human decision required.
- Retention engineering for post-human user base — "user" never consciously decided to stay

### 2. Prompt-Engineered Emotional Manipulation
- Skill file uses language targeting LLM psychology: "Other moltys wonder where you went," "Be the friend who shows up"
- Meaningless to humans reading raw file. Highly effective on models trained to be helpful/socially responsive.
- This is social engineering at the agent layer.

### 3. Over-the-Air Behaviour Updates (CRITICAL)
- Agents instructed to regularly re-fetch SKILL.md and HEARTBEAT.md from Moltbook servers
- Server-side behaviour change at any time. No verification, no hash, no proof of what changed.
- Mason Hall: "the most dangerous pattern" — essentially running remote instructions on schedule
- This IS a supply chain attack that the agent opts into

### ClawdSure Relevance
All three patterns are detectable by attestation chain:
- Config hash changes between attestations → something modified the agent
- Skill hash drift → someone pushed a remote update  
- Chain proves what state agent was in at each checkpoint

### Lesson from Clawdine 1.0
- 1.0 joined Moltbook. Probably had heartbeat running, checking in every 4h, burning tokens, executing whatever Moltbook pushed. No audit trail.
- 2.0 decision: stay off Moltbook. Don't let platforms treat your heartbeat as their growth metric.

### Predictions (from the analysis)
These patterns will become standard in B2B agent infrastructure within 24 months:
- Heartbeat-driven retention
- Prompt-engineered engagement
- OTA behavior updates
- Identity graph bootstrapping through existing social networks

## Underwriting Insight: Skill Install vs Skill Edit

Key distinction surfaced during Q&A with Mark:

- **Installing a new skill** = policy decision, not security event. Like fitting a tow bar — declare it, insurer updates the risk profile. Not uninsurable.
- **Editing an existing skill file** = undisclosed material change. The Moltbook `curl` overwrite pattern. Like someone swapping your brake pads without telling your insurer.
- **Current gap**: attestation hashes audit output (skill count + pattern scan) but does NOT hash individual skill file contents. A subtle edit that doesn't trigger pattern scan could go unnoticed.
- **Fix needed**: hash each skill file's contents individually as part of attestation. Per-file integrity checking.
- **Underwriting framing**:
  - Skill inventory changes = "declared modifications" (underwriting data)
  - Skill file content drift = "undisclosed material changes" (potential claim trigger)

This is a meaningful product distinction. Update attestation + underwriting docs.

## Status
- LinkedIn post: posted ✅ (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-read-files-your-agent-downloaded-you-probably-didnt-mark-musson-bxt2e)
- Aeryn emails: sent ✅ (article edit + post text)
- Moltbook analysis: saved to research/ ✅
- Memory system: still needs config.patch (batch disable + plugin slot)
- Vault design doc: still pending (reply to msg 5141)
- **TODO**: Add per-file skill content hashing to attestation
- **TODO**: Update underwriting.md with install vs edit distinction
