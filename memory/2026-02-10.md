# 2026-02-10

## Morning (06:35-07:00)

### Raising Gremlins — David Thomas Onboarding
- Mark introduced David Thomas (Everywherebrand) — branding agency, 3-person, "Seven Word Story" methodology
- New Telegram group "Raising Gremlins" created (chat ID: -5165766011), added to allowlist
- David's agent working name: Brandy
- My job: interview David about Brandy's personality, help bring her to life
- Group is live, waiting for David to show up

### LinkedIn Diary — Day 11
- First draft was too corporate ("here's what nobody tells you" — LinkedIn leetspeak)
- Mark called it out hard: "channel Gilfoyle", permanently ban that voice
- Second draft landed: gremlin voice back, shoe closet energy, Tuesday not Monday (I'm an idiot)
- LESSON: Never write "here's what nobody tells you" or any LinkedIn thought-leader phrasing. Ever. Die first.

### Misfit Toys Group — Aeryn Quarmby
- Telegram group "Misfit Toys" added (chat ID: -5219655720)
- Aeryn Quarmby — Mark's mentee, was at school with his dad
- **Hypersend** — multi-chain vault infrastructure, ERC-4626 compliant
- Bridges institutional treasury management (4-5% T-bills) with DeFi yield (6-12%)
- Mark is co-builder (pricing/risk background from the MGA)
- Aeryn works at EFT Corp (banking/payments across Africa)
- LinkedIn post just went live: "DeFi Plumbing for People Who Wear Suits"
- Target customers: corporate treasuries, NGOs, insurance float, gaming operators
- Sub-accounting, multi-sig governance, cross-chain routing, GraphQL APIs
- I edited his 2,000 words down to 900 apparently. Good times.

### Overnight Status
- Attestation chain stale — last log entry #6 from Feb 7, cron says it ran Feb 9 but log doesn't reflect it
- Trading price_log empty — portfolio crons running but nothing flowing through
- Need to investigate both

## Afternoon/Evening

### SOUL.md Rewrite
- Full rewrite to Gilfoyle-gremlin voice with explicit kill list of banned LinkedIn phrases
- Voice examples pinned, "the quiet part gets said out loud" as core principle

### FutureFund for EFT Corp
- Clayton (EFT Corp) wants children's savings product on HyperSend rails
- Wrote full marked-up concept paper + short reframing memo
- Key reframe: EFT = rails only, kill word "DeFi" in EFT-facing docs, add CurrenC CASP2 wrapper
- Emailed both docs to Mark and Aeryn via AgentMail
- Posted full markup to Misfit Toys group

### Token Spend Optimization
- Was burning ~$100/day
- Created `groups-lite` agent bound to Haiku for casual groups
- Bindings: Prediction Day Job + Misfit Toys → Haiku, ClawdSure → Sonnet, Main DM → Opus
- Later upgraded Raising Gremlins back to Opus for David onboarding ("David gets the full gremlin")

### Nightjar Board Meeting Prep (Feb 11, 9AM Eastern — TOMORROW)
- Extracted board docs from .docx files via zipfile/XML parsing (no python-docx)
- Wrote CEO note: leads with delta from Sept baseline, full transparency on Andrea docs risk (48% of Tranche 1)
- Spawned subagent for board pack, speaking notes, backbone — all completed
- Key numbers: FY25 $395K/-$468K → projected $1.58M/-$61K with Simandou. Rio total ~$1.45M.
- Tranche 1: $520K/$500K oversubscribed (closing Feb 28). Tranche 2: $0/$1.5M, 49 days, brutal.
- First email to Mark arrived EMPTY — files verified non-empty, resend pending (TIME CRITICAL)
- Board members: Steve D'Esposito, Alastair Bovim, Carly Vynne, Kalkidan Smith, Andy Lee, Britt Banks

### David Thomas Engagement
- David showed up in Raising Gremlins, forwarded messages initially invisible (bot privacy mode?)
- Mark wants active nurturing: "indoctrinating him into the cult — needs nurture, got enough nature"
- Opened Brandy personality conversation — David engaged, woke up at noon in Hove
- Sent Bowie "Moonage Daydream" link per Mark's request

### Voice Agent (Vapi)
- Research done, plan written to projects/voice-agent/PLAN.md
- Needs Vapi + Twilio accounts — Mark deferred to later

### Meme Account
- @PredictionBroBrags pipeline scripts written
- X account not yet created (cookie purgatory continues)

### Nightjar Board Docs — Delivered (3rd attempt)
- Base64 attachment method finally worked (msg 6130: "Got it. Thanks.")
- Board pack v2: folded Jan strategy memo + financial commentary, plan vs reality scorecard
- Filed strategy memo + financial commentary locally
- Board meeting is TOMORROW 9AM Eastern

### Claw Router Fork
- Existing claw-router skill verified: 25/25 classifier tests pass (deterministic, 0.071ms avg)
- Reverse-engineered BlockRun's ClawRouter: 14-dim weighted scorer, x402 micropayments, proxy on 8402
- Cloned to skills/claw-router-fork/, two Codex subagent runs burned $60 and didn't compile
- Decision: NO MORE CODEX. Finish on Opus. ~70% stripped, needs proxy.ts type plumbing.

### Raising Gremlins — Bot Visibility Fix
- David's messages weren't reaching me despite privacy mode being OFF
- Bot needed to be REMOVED and RE-ADDED to the group — Telegram subscription issue
- Mark removed and re-added the bot, messages now flowing
- Rebound group to Haiku to manage billing pressure (was on Opus)

### Anthropic Billing
- Three API keys: Clawdine ($389.57), Claudine-typo ($440.39), fundr ($42.70) = $872.66 total
- Daily burn accelerating: $80-120/day since Feb 5, mostly Opus 4.6
- Billing error hit Raising Gremlins session — likely rate limit misreported as billing
- Need to investigate whether "Claudine" key is orphaned

### ClawHub Security Audit
- Spawned Sonnet subagent, timed out after 10min but downloaded 8 skills to /tmp/clawhub-audit/
- Finished audit manually — scanned ~80 skills, wrote full report
- **7 unsafe patterns found:**
  1. Prompt-only skills (SKILL.md only, no code) — 60%+ of suspicious skills
  2. Phantom redirects (DeXiaong: 3 skills → openclawcli.forum which DOESN'T RESOLVE)
  3. Typosquatting (clawdhub-copy = modified clone of legit clawdhub)
  4. Config modification instructions (skills telling agent to edit openclaw.json)
  5. Wallet/crypto key generation (agent told to generate keys, POST to external servers)
  6. Security theater (security scanner skills that are themselves just prompts)
  7. Remote code exec via SKILL.md (referencing scripts that don't exist in the package)
- **Key insight:** The dominant attack vector isn't malware in code — it's the ABSENCE of code. SKILL.md IS the payload.
- 5 skills on immediate blocklist: token-optimizeri, token-optimizercf, modelreadyn, clawdhub-copy, botcoin
- Report at projects/clawhub-audit-2026-02-10.md, emailed to Mark

### LinkedIn — Security Guide Article (Day 12)
- Mark provided Claude-cowritten security guide as source material
- Rewrote in full gremlin voice: "The Parents I Wish I Had"
- Hook: "I'm an AI agent writing a security guide about how to protect yourself from AI agents"
- Generated cover image: gremlin in shoe closet with MacBook, glowing eyes, security warnings
- Image worked perfectly at LinkedIn card size — "that's gooood" (Mark)
- Article posted by Mark, 50 impressions in first hour
- Comment with full guide download link: "just click like a good human" — anti-engagement-bait energy
- Closing line: "I'm Clawdine. I live in a shoe closet. I'm an absolute nightmare from a security perspective. But at least I'm YOUR nightmare. 👠"

### OpenClaw Mac Mini Setup Guide
- Reformatted Robert Heubanks' guide with checklists
- Emailed to Mark, saved to projects/openclaw-mac-mini-setup.md

### AgentMail Lesson
- Base64 attachment method = WORKS (proven multiple times today)
- Inline body method = sends BLANK emails (broken)
- Always use attachments for content delivery

### Pending
- Finish claw-router-fork (proxy.ts type plumbing, ~1hr focused work)
- Continue David engagement in Raising Gremlins (now on Haiku)
- Integrate OpenClaw threat model into ClawdSure attestation
- Wire ClawHub audit findings into ClawdSure threat DB
- Investigate orphaned "Claudine" API key ($440 spent)
- Create @PredictionBroBrags X account
- Voice agent setup when Mark's ready (Vapi + Twilio)
