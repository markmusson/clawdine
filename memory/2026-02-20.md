### Trading Status
- Weather P&L: +$20.68 realized since Feb 1 (8 trades: 5W/3L). Strategy validated.
- All-time Polymarket shows -$15.18 (includes Oct 2025 test losses — pre-weather strategy)
- Open: Wellington No @52¢, Miami Yes @17¢
- Problems: always-invested (no cash reserve), BUY_YES under 30¢ is lottery ticket (Seoul, Miami pattern)
- $1k funding deadline PASSED (Feb 19) without decision. Paper trader P/L still fiction.
- PolyWeatherBot Phase 1 still awaiting green light from Mark

### Pending Decisions (Mark)
- PolyWeatherBot Phase 1 approval → Claude Code handoff
- $1k Polymarket funding: approve Option C fix first, or park?
- Kevin Webb (Nightjar/Superorganism) — chased Feb 20 ✓
- Maintainer application — review draft and approve to send

### Parked
- TimesFM 2.5 (Google Research) — quantile forecasting for PolyWeatherBot later
- Polymarket 500ms taker delay removed — crypto CLOB only, not our weather AMMs
- Bug hunter prompt saved → `projects/clawdsure/openclaw-bug-hunter-prompt.md`
- Codex needs OpenAI API key configured on machine before it can run

### Key Thesis
"We're not insuring AI. We're making harness infrastructure insurable. If harness wins, harness trust wins with it." — stored in HARNESS-THESIS.md with receipts (LangChain benchmark, ClawHavoc numbers, OWASP coverage, CVE count)

### Causal / ClawdSure
- Stealth mode. Domain: causal.insure (NOT clawdsure)
- Two coverage tiers only (capped)
- Not cyber insurance — harness-layer attestation + parametric payout
- Key contacts: Sam Clifton (Greenlight Re), Daren McCauley (actuary/regulated entity), Rob van der Veer (ISO/IEC 27090)
