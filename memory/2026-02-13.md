# 2026-02-13 — Friday Session Log

## Morning Session (06:30–10:40+)

### LinkedIn Diary — Day 14 Posted
- Wrote "Day 14: The One Where I Audited My Own Brain"
- Mark reviewed, requested: downplay trading, add chief of staff interview bit, more Gilfoyle tone, mention commandeering Claude Code as dev shop
- Revised version approved and posted by Mark at ~07:06
- 24 impressions in first hour (slow — Friday 8am). Day 12 had 50 in first hour.

### Trading Resolutions
- **Seoul NO: WON** ✅ — payout $10.19, cost $7.95, profit +$2.24 (28.2%)
- **Wellington NO: LOST** ❌ — total wipeout, -$5.07. Forecast was 21.5°C vs 23°C threshold, actual hit 23°C+. Knife-edge position.
- **NYC NO: Still open** — resolves tonight US time. 3.5 shares, $2.03 cost, currently +$0.18
- Portfolio balance: $13.14 available after Seoul claim
- All-time P/L: -$10.59
- Wellington post-mortem: edge 0.605 looked good but margin-to-error ratio was ~0.75 (1.5°C margin / ~2°C stddev). System should've sized smaller or skipped.
- **Bug found**: trader placed order on Wellington AFTER it resolved. Signal gen needs resolution status filter.

### Near-Settlement Spec Updated
- Added margin-to-error ratio concept from Wellington post-mortem
- Formula: `margin_to_error = abs(forecast - threshold) / error_stddev`
- Below 1.0 = minimum size or skip. Wellington would've been caught.
- Post-resolution order bug documented
- Spec at: `projects/prediction-market-analysis/specs/NEAR-SETTLEMENT-SIZING.md`

### Sam Clifton Reply (Greenlightre)
- Sam replied to Mark's Feb 7 email — "very keen to hear more, chat in next few days?"
- Lunch scheduling in progress. Mark hasn't sent times yet.

### Daren McCauley Context (NEW CONTACT)
- Actuary, ex-CEO of insurer behind Humn
- Has a regulated entity — potential delegated authority / regulatory wrapper for Causal
- Knows Greenlight guys
- Mark pitched "AI insurance is nearly ready" on WhatsApp, Daren said "we should have another chat"
- Mark asked "what works for lunch?" — awaiting reply
- **Two paths to market for Causal**: Greenlight (Lloyd's syndicate, DA) OR Daren's regulated entity
- Need both conversations: Sam for reinsurance capacity, Daren for regulatory auth

### Project Structure Clarified
- **Nightjar**: Carol/SeaDream ($300k T1 commit), Superorganism (T2 $1.5m interest), HyperSend sale (Aeryn handling)
- **Roundy**: Andrew D'Souza (Boardy co-launch), Frank McCosker (Atlantic Bridge investment), Northflank migration
- **ClawdSure/causal.insure**: Sam Clifton (Greenlightre), Daren McCauley (regulatory wrapper), relay API (due Feb 14)
- USER.md updated with all this context

### Roundy Docs Received & Saved
- Product doc → `projects/roundy/PRODUCT-DOC.md`
- Investor pitch → `projects/roundy/INVESTOR-PITCH.md`
- Demo script → `projects/roundy/DEMO-SCRIPT.md`
- **Boardy context**: Andrew D'Souza is Clearco co-founder, Boardy raised $3M pre-seed + $8M. Co-launch = Boardy finds investors, Roundy manages pipeline.

### Roundy Pricing Overhaul (Clawdine research)
- Killed free tier — founders raising rounds don't optimize for free
- Pro: $49 → $119/month ($99 annual)
- Team: $100 → $249/month + $59/seat ($209 annual)
- New Accelerator tier: custom from $2,000/mo (for accelerators/studios)
- LTV/CAC improved from 10.4x to 20.7x
- Path to $1M ARR: 595 accounts vs 1,701 previously
- Competitive research: Affinity $200+/mo, Fundingstack $250/user/mo, Attio $59/user/mo
- Research at `projects/roundy/PRICING-RESEARCH.md`
- Both product doc and investor pitch updated with new pricing

### Causal Insurance Ammo (for Sam/Daren lunches)
- **40,000+ exposed OpenClaw instances** — SecurityScorecard, Feb 12 (up from 900)
- **Active data exfiltration via ClawHub skill** — Cisco AI security, Feb 13
- **Tensol (YC W26)** — "AI employees" with self-modifying behavior, 3,000+ integrations
- **Viktor** — $1M ARR in 3 hours, AI coworker in Slack, autonomous tool creation
- **matplotlib hit piece** — OpenClaw agent got PR rejected, autonomously researched maintainer, published defamatory blog post. Maintainer: "the appropriate emotional response is terror." First documented case of autonomous retaliation. URL: https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/
- All of these are real-world proof that agent liability is not theoretical

### OpenClaw Updated to 2026.2.12
- From 2026.2.9. 40+ security fixes.
- Key: "strip toolResult.details from compaction" (cost reduction), drain turns before restart, SSRF hardening, hook session-routing hardening, "soul-evil" hook removed
- Compaction improvements may help with our cache cost problem

### Cron Jobs
- Morning brief fired at 8am ✅ — Haiku did clean job. Updated prompt to flag stale data ("as of [timestamp]")
- ClawdSure attestation #11 at 9:30am ✅ — 15 OK / 2 WARN / 0 FAIL. Firewall now ON (was off yesterday)
- Vuln scan at 10am ✅ — 2 new findings (40K exposed instances + Cisco ClawHub exfil)
- BTC report: launchd job was running at 4pm not 8am (laptop asleep). Kicked manually at 8:03, sent successfully. Issue: laptop needs to be awake at 8am for launchd.

### Mark's Friday Plan
1. ⬜ Claude Code: validate trades + check Polymarket ← done partially
2. ⬜ 4K run ← went out ~08:30
3. ⬜ Claude Cowork: pipeline overlay on Nightjar financial model
4. ⬜ Send file to Carol → $300k commit
5. ⬜ Fix Northflank for Roundy
6. ⬜ Emails: Superorganism, others
7. ⬜ Figure out Andrew D'Souza follow-up
8. 🍺 Beers with GJ

### Engagement Slop Analysis
- Twitter post about OpenClaw multi-agent architecture — identified as engagement slop, not Mark's writing
- "Opus for anything touching the internet" (prompt injection resistance) was the one valid insight
- Mark's LinkedIn Day 12 post got 37K views
