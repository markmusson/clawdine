# FutureFund × EFT Corp: Reframing Memo

**One page. Three moves. One question answered.**

---

## The Question Clayton Is Asking

"Whose balance sheet touches the money when something goes wrong?"

**Answer: Not EFT's.**

---

## What EFT Does (and Doesn't Do)

| EFT's Role | NOT EFT's Role |
|---|---|
| Regulated ZAR conversion & settlement rails | Fund custody |
| Fiat on/off-ramp infrastructure | Yield promises to consumers |
| Reporting, reconciliation & audit trail | Consumer-facing product liability |
| KYC/AML processing via existing compliance stack | Investment advice or financial product issuance |

EFT provides the **regulated plumbing** between the consumer's bank account and the licensed product issuer. That's it. No new risk surface. No balance sheet exposure. No reputational linkage to yield performance.

---

## The Regulatory Stack (Already Solved)

| Layer | Entity | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **CASP2 licence** (crypto asset service provider) | CurrenC | **Available now** |
| **Fiat rails** (conversion, settlement, reporting) | EFT Corp | **Existing capability** |
| **Vault infrastructure** (multi-chain, ERC-4626, sub-accounting) | HyperSend | **Built** |
| **Consumer product wrapper** (savings product, FSCA-registered) | FutureFund SPV | **To be established** |

The CASP2 wrapper via CurrenC means the crypto-to-fiat bridge is **already regulated**. This isn't a "we'll figure out licensing later" situation. The regulatory perimeter exists today.

---

## What EFT Is Actually Being Asked To Do

Provide the same rails EFT already operates — conversion, settlement, reconciliation — to a **new product category**: long-duration, auditable, pooled savings with programmable allocation.

No new capabilities. No new risk. New revenue from existing infrastructure.

---

## Why EFT Should Care (Option Value, Not Revenue Projections)

This isn't about one children's savings app. It's about being the **regulated settlement layer** for tokenised savings products across Southern Africa.

**The template applies to:**
- Housing deposit funds
- Retirement savings wrappers
- Employee benefit schemes
- Cross-border remittance-to-savings products
- NGO program fund management

FutureFund is the first use case. The infrastructure serves all of them.

**First-mover position:** First regulated, tokenised savings wrapper in Southern Africa. That's a defensible position that compounds — every additional product category runs on the same rails.

---

## The Commercial Structure

```
Consumer (ZAR) → EFT (fiat rails) → CurrenC (CASP2 regulated conversion) 
    → HyperSend (vault infrastructure) → DeFi yield protocols
```

- **EFT** earns on conversion, settlement, and reporting (per-transaction + monthly platform fee)
- **CurrenC** earns on the regulated crypto conversion (spread + compliance fee)
- **HyperSend** earns on vault infrastructure (basis points on AUM)
- **FutureFund SPV** is the licensed product issuer, carries the consumer relationship

Each entity holds **only its own risk**. No co-mingling. No ambiguity.

---

## What Breaks If EFT Says No

Honest answer: the fiat rails become harder, slower, and more expensive. EFT's existing banking integrations, reconciliation engine, and compliance infrastructure across Africa are the difference between a 6-month launch and an 18-month slog through bilateral bank negotiations.

EFT's absence doesn't kill the product. It cripples the go-to-market.

## Next Step

A 30-minute conversation between Clayton, Aeryn, and Mark to align on:

1. EFT's specific commercial terms for rails provision
2. CurrenC integration timeline for CASP2 wrapper
3. FutureFund SPV structure and FSCA registration path

No pitch. No deck. Just structure.
