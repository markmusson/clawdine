# Causal / ClawdSure — Project Context

## What This Is
AI agent security insurance product. Attestation-based underwriting — daily automated audits generate cryptographic chain of evidence.

## Key Files
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — v2 attestation suite design (soul-guardian pattern, unified chain)
- `DESIGN.md` — v3.1 product design (rewritten, 16KB)
- `DEAL-SHEET.md` — one-page deal sheet for Sam Clifton / Daren McCauley
- `AMMO.md` — pitch ammunition (incidents, market data, competitor analysis)
- `PITCH-NARRATIVE.md` — full pitch document
- `WATCHLIST.md` — threat intelligence watchlist
- `CLAWSEC-SECURITY-AUDIT.md` — audit of ClawSec suite components
- `specs/CAUSAL-ATTESTATION-SPEC.md` — unified attestation spec (needs OWASP cleanup)
- `specs/VERCEL-ATTESTATION.md` — Vercel AI SDK attestation design

## Domain
causal.insure (NOT clawdsure)

## Stealth Mode
DO NOT discuss ClawdSure details publicly. Hint and tease only.

## Key Decisions
- NOT cyber insurance — two capped tiers only
- Tier 1: £50/yr, £500 cap (parametric-like B2C, gadget insurance model)
- Tier 2: £5K/yr, £25K cap (SME, daily telematics, short-tail capped)
- Exclude enterprise — that's traditional cyber
- soul-guardian pattern = foundation for all attestation (not just files)
- One canonical chain for everything (files, config, CVE, audit, skills, network)
- OWASP AI Exchange (owaspai.org) is the real standards reference, NOT "OWASP Agentic Top 10 2026"

## Standards
- OWASP AI Exchange (owaspai.org) — 300+ pages, Flagship project, CC0
- ISO/IEC 27090 — expected mid-2026
- OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI Applications (Dec 2025)

## Key Contacts
- Sam Clifton (Greenlight Re) — reinsurer, lunch pending
- Daren McCauley — actuary, regulated entity, fastest path to market

## Rules
- Write for underwriters who aren't tech people
- Plain English up front, technical detail in appendices
- Use analogies: telematics boxes, phone insurance, MOT certificates, fleet management
- Always verify standards references (sub-agent hallucinated OWASP refs before)
