# Causal — Deal Sheet
**AI Agent Security Insurance**  
**Confidential — February 2026**

---

## The Opportunity

No insurance product covers the adversarial security risks of autonomous AI agents. The January 2026 Verisk ISO exclusion forms are stripping AI coverage from standard policies. 40,000+ agent instances are exposed, 9,000+ already compromised. The protection gap is widening at the exact moment the threat has materialised.

**Category:** New asset class (agent security), not cyber liability  
**Analogy:** Motor telematics (1996–present), software-only from Day 1  
**Domain:** causal.insure

## Product Structure

|  | Tier 1: Personal | Tier 2: SME |
|---|---|---|
| **Target** | Individual developers, hobbyists, solo agents | Businesses running production agents |
| **Premium** | £50/year | £5,000/year |
| **Cap** | £500 per incident | £25,000 per incident |
| **Aggregate limit** | £1,000/year | £50,000/year |
| **Tail** | Short (≤90 days) | Short (≤90 days) |
| **Triggers** | Attestation chain break, verified credential theft, supply chain compromise | Same + operational disruption, data exfiltration, rogue agent behavior |
| **Evidence** | Daily automated attestation chain (cryptographic, hash-linked) | Same + enhanced monitoring (config drift, CVE response time, file integrity) |
| **Claims** | Near-parametric: chain break + verified loss = payout | Evidence-based: attestation data + loss documentation |
| **Model** | Gadget insurance / phone screen cover | Fleet telematics / SME cyber (capped) |

**Excluded:** Enterprise (>£25K premium). That's traditional cyber territory.  
**Excluded:** AI performance liability (hallucinations, bias, errors). Armilla/Testudo cover that.

## Underwriting Model

**Attestation-based.** Policyholders run a daily automated security audit that generates a cryptographic chain of evidence — hash-linked, tamper-evident, independently verifiable. This is the telematics box equivalent: continuous risk data, not annual questionnaires.

**Attestation covers:**
- File integrity (identity files, configuration)
- Installed component inventory (hashed, version-tracked)
- CVE exposure (cross-referenced against live advisory feeds)
- Security audit results (OpenClaw native + deep probes)
- Network posture (listening ports, firewall state)
- Configuration drift (model settings, auth profiles, tool policies)

**Risk scoring:** Attestation data generates a daily security posture score. Continuous clean attestation = lower risk = renewal discount. Gaps in attestation chain = higher risk = premium surcharge or non-renewal.

**Data flywheel:** More policyholders → more attestation data → better risk models → more accurate pricing → ability to attract low-risk agents → lower loss ratios → more competitive premiums → more policyholders. This is Progressive's 14 billion miles, but for agent security.

## Year 1 Financials (Conservative)

| Metric | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Combined |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Policies** | 5,000 | 100 | 5,100 |
| **GWP** | £250,000 | £500,000 | £750,000 |
| **Expected frequency** | 8–12% | 3–5% | — |
| **Average claim** | £200 | £8,000 | — |
| **Expected losses** | £80,000 | £32,000 | £112,000 |
| **Loss ratio** | 32% | 6.4% | **14.9%** |
| **Expense ratio** | — | — | **35–40%** |
| **Combined ratio** | — | — | **50–55%** |

**Key assumptions:**
- Tier 1 frequency based on February 2026 incident rate (~22% compromise of exposed agents), adjusted for attestation-active agents having lower exposure
- Tier 2 frequency discounted further: SME agents better maintained, daily monitoring, faster remediation
- Short-tail capped exposure limits downside — maximum aggregate loss: £5.25M (all policies, all claims, max payout)
- No IBNR tail: 90-day reporting window, parametric-like triggers

**Year 3 target:** 25,000 Tier 1 + 500 Tier 2 = £3.75M GWP, combined ratio 45–50%  
**Year 5 target:** 100,000 Tier 1 + 2,000 Tier 2 = £15M GWP, combined ratio 40–45%

## Capacity & Structure

| Component | Year 1 | Year 3 |
|---|---|---|
| **Required capacity** | £5M | £15M |
| **Quota share** | 70% ceded | 50% ceded |
| **Ceding commission** | 27.5% base, sliding to 32.5% | 30% base, sliding to 35% |
| **MGA retention** | 15% | 25% |
| **Fronting fee** | 7.5% (if fronting required) | 5% |
| **Reinsurer participation** | 1 lead | 2–3 panel |

**Lead reinsurer ask:** £5M capacity, Year 1, with co-development support on risk models.

**Preferred partners:**
1. **Greenlight Re Innovations** — equity + capacity model, Lloyd's Syndicate 3456, AI/IoT focus
2. **Munich Re** — aiSure pedigree, Insurtech Programs team, Innovation Syndicate at Lloyd's
3. **Swiss Re** — parametric expertise, API-automated claims, $40B+ balance sheet

## Capital Requirements (MGA)

| Item | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Regulatory setup** | £150–250K | FCA authorisation or Delegated Authority via partner |
| **Technology** | £100–150K | Attestation platform, underwriting API, claims system |
| **Operations (Year 1)** | £200–300K | Team, compliance, actuarial |
| **Working capital** | £100–150K | Float, cash reserves |
| **Total seed** | **£550K–850K** | |

**Funding path:**
- Tranche 1: £500K (seed — build MGA, secure DA, launch Tier 1)
- Tranche 2: £1.5M (scale — hire, Tier 2 launch, second reinsurer)

**Alternative:** Greenlight Re equity + capacity model eliminates separate equity raise — GRI invests alongside providing capacity.

## Regulatory Pathway

| Route | Timeline | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FCA AI Live Testing** (Cohort 2, open now) | 6–12 months | Sandbox waivers, regulatory guidance, 50% more likely to raise funding | Competitive application |
| **Lloyd's Product Launchpad** | 12–18 months | £150M capacity, ICX innovation class, credibility | Lloyd's process overhead |
| **Delegated Authority** (via Greenlight or partner) | 3–6 months | Fastest to market, uses partner's regulatory wrapper | Revenue share, less control |
| **Daren McCauley's regulated entity** | 1–3 months | Existing authorisation, actuary-led | Scope limitations TBD |

**Recommended:** Dual-track — Daren's entity for immediate Tier 1 launch + FCA sandbox application for long-term independence.

## Competitive Position

| Competitor | Coverage | Stage | Differentiator vs Causal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Armilla AI** | AI performance liability | Live (Lloyd's) | Covers hallucinations, not security attacks |
| **Testudo** | AI third-party liability | Live (Lloyd's) | Covers litigation, not agent-level threats |
| **Munich Re aiSure** | AI performance guarantee | Live | Covers drift, not adversarial attacks |
| **AIUC** | Agent-level insurance | Pre-revenue | No product, no underwriter, no attestation |
| **Google Cloud RPP** | Cloud AI endorsement | Live (Beazley/Chubb) | Google customers only |
| **Causal** | **Agent security** | **Design** | **Attestation-based, continuous, parametric-like** |

**Moat:** Attestation data. Every day of operation generates proprietary risk data that compounds into actuarial advantage. By Year 3, the dataset is unreplicable — same dynamic as Progressive's telematics data.
