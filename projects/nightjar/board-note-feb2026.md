# Nightjar — CEO Note to Board
**Ahead of Board Meeting, 11 February 2026**

## Since September

Last board meeting: $395K revenue, $468K net loss, cash out by November without Tranche 1. That was five months ago. Here's what changed.

Rio Tinto went from 30 units in Guinea to 450 deployed, $601K contracted, and Phase 2 now confirmed — $600K from July, $250K carried into 2027. Total relationship: ~$1.45M. This went from "important pilot" to our largest customer, our reference account, and the proof that TG-4 sells at enterprise scale.

Revenue with Simandou: $1.58M projected (vs $395K FY25). EBIT improved from -$468K to -$61K projected.

## Funding

**Tranche 1: $520K committed / $500K target. Oversubscribed. Closing Feb 28.**

| Investor | Amount | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Andrea Chiesi (Ancusa srl) | $250K | Docs pending — 48% of committed, needs closing this week |
| Seadream Foundation | $200K | Existing investor, pro-rata |
| Blake Rhodes | $50K | Angel (via Britt) |
| George Kelly | $20K | Family office |

Andrea's paperwork is the critical path. Everything else is ready.

**Tranche 2: $1.5M target @ $10M pre-money. Zero committed. 49 days to close.**

Two qualified leads — Tom Keane (warm, via Carly) and Pete Cushman (hot, family office, via Carly). Nine have passed. This is where I need the board's network. Rio Phase 2 confirmation materially changes the Tranche 2 conversation, but we need introductions to have it.

Without Tranche 1: breach in November. With Tranche 1 + Rio Phase 2 cash from July: funded into 2027. Tranche 2 is about scaling production and the data platform, not survival.

## Commercial

Pipeline is broadly unchanged from August: ~20 hard orders, ~35 near-POs, ~160 priority units from ~280 forecast. The conversion gap is ops and CRM discipline, not demand. Sales remains founder-led with Richard and RESOLVE. That's fine until post-raise.

## Team

Same story as August, now more urgent. Andy is carrying product, customer success, and ops — needs relief. Fergus is bottlenecked on firmware. Post-raise plan unchanged: data scientist, data engineer, full-stack. We won't hire ahead of cash.

## Governance — four items, no debates

1. **LLC → C-Corp conversion** — approve resolution
2. **Eric Dinnerstein share purchase** — close cleanly, preserve IP
3. **Mark's board seat via RESOLVE** — confirm
4. **Chip order + fundraise positioning** — approve

## What I need from the board

Introductions to 3-5 corporates who buy like Rio — mining, energy, infrastructure. Alignment that we lead enterprise conversations with compliance and environmental performance, not conservation storytelling. And air cover to quietly reset a small number of legacy relationships.

## By next board

- Rio Phase 2 authorised or clear reason why not
- Additional customers live and paying
- Tranche 1 closed
- Tranche 2 pipeline real, not theoretical
