# NIGHTJAR LLC — 2026 Strategy & Goal-Setting Memo

**Confidential | January 2026**

## Executive Summary

2026 is a proof year. The product works. That question has been answered in the field. The question now is whether the business holds together when pushed. This year is about crossing the line from a technically validated system to something repeatable, durable, and economically sound. Something that behaves the same way at 50 units as it does at 500. Something that can be trusted.

By the end of December 2026, Nightjar will be running more than 785 cameras in live deployments. The platform will generate positive SaaS unit economics at scale. Four production batches will have shipped under a disciplined just-in-time model. The company will exit the year with more than $980K in cash and an operating runway that stretches well into 2027.

The plan is deliberately tight. There are no regions to optimise, no layers to manage, and no initiatives whose only job is to sound important. Everything reduces to five priorities. Each one is measured quarterly. Each one has a clear owner. Each one touches cash.

## 1. 2026 Vision

The ambition for 2026 is simple and narrow. Nightjar will establish itself as the market leader in AI-powered wildlife monitoring by proving three things beyond doubt: the economics scale, the operations hold, and the commercial model repeats.

That proof creates the conditions for faster growth in 2027 and 2028, without increasing risk.

Credibility matters more than expansion. With customers who rely on the system in difficult environments. With funders and regulators who care about evidence, not intention. With future partners and acquirers who look for discipline before momentum.

## 2. Strategic Priorities for 2026

### Priority 1 — Scale Production Reliably

Production has to become boring. Four batches will be executed through VVDN, delivering 2,000 units in total under a just-in-time model. Timing matters. Quality matters. Surprises are the enemy. Success looks like every batch arriving when expected, and nothing on the line that forces a scramble or a workaround.

### Priority 2 — Validate Unit Economics

The platform has been built to get cheaper as it grows. Now it has to prove that it does. Cloud costs will compress as the installed base expands and infrastructure is amortised properly. SaaS margins will move from structurally negative to clearly positive.

This shift is not theoretical. It shows up in billing. By December, SaaS gross margin clears 51%. Cloud cost per unit falls below $25. The direction is locked in.

### Priority 3 — Build a Real Sales Engine

Interest and pipeline already exist. Reference deployments exist. The work now is conversion. Sales in 2026 are about consistency. Not heroics. Not one-off wins. Units move through the system across multiple channels, week after week, without drama.

The target is 787 units sold across the year, ending with a live installed base of 785 cameras. The gap between sale, install, and activation continues to shrink.

### Priority 4 — Secure and Deploy Capital

The $2M SAFE closes in two steps. $500K in February. $1.5M by March. Capital is deployed with restraint. It goes into production, platform stability, and the minimum team required to support growth. It does not chase optionality. The runway remains intact. The purpose of the raise is not speed. It is certainty.

### Priority 5 — Scale the Team Only When Earned

Hiring follows reality, not ambition. The team stays at four until the installed base crosses 500 units. At that point, an operations lead and a data scientist are added. Not before. Not just in case. Headcount growth is a response to load, not a bet on future demand.

## 3. 2026 Scorecard

**By year end:**

| Category | Metric | Target |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Growth** | Units sold | 787 |
| | Live units | 785 |
| | Total revenue | $992K |
| **Unit Economics** | SaaS margin | -69% → 51% |
| | Blended gross margin | ~50% |
| **Financial** | EBIT | -$338K (deliberate investment year) |
| | Closing cash | $983K |
| | Runway | 18+ months |
| **Operations** | Production batches | 4 |
| | Units manufactured | 2,000 |
| | Team size | 6 |

## 4. Strategic Objectives by Quarter

### Q1 — Foundation
Funding closes. The first batch arrives. Sales go live across every channel. Cloud costs are validated with real traffic, not assumptions. The third production order is placed. The aim is to remove uncertainty from the system.

### Q2 — Scale
The second batch ships. The installed base reaches 330 units. Tier-1 cloud pricing is locked. The fourth production order is placed. The system repeats without friction.

### Q3 — Team Build
Batch three lands. The installed base crosses 500 units. Operations and data leadership are added. SaaS margins push past 45%. The structure strengthens under load.

### Q4 — Prove the Model
The final batch of the year arrives. 785 cameras are active in the field. SaaS margin clears 51%. The first 2027 production order is placed. The 2027 operating plan is finalised. The year ends without open questions.

## 5. Financial Targets

Revenue in 2026 remains hardware-led, with SaaS and services building steadily underneath. Hardware contributes roughly two-thirds of revenue. SaaS approaches a quarter. Services remain supportive rather than dominant.

Costs stay tight. Hardware COGS remain fixed at validated levels. Cloud costs fall as scale increases. Operating expenses grow only where capacity is demonstrably constrained. Manufacturing cash outflows align precisely with batch deliveries. Inventory does not accumulate. Hiring does not run ahead of proof.

## 6. What Is Not Being Prioritised

2026 is not the year for geographic sprawl. It is not the year for new product lines beyond TG-4 and IQ GA. It is not the year to build a sales team ahead of demand. It is not the year for bespoke deployments that cannot be repeated. It is not the year for long-horizon research disconnected from near-term revenue.

Execution comes first.

## 7. Risks and Mitigation

Supply chain delays remain a possibility. Long lead times and prepaid components reduce the impact. Cloud costs have already been tested against real billing. Committed use discounts are in place. Sales velocity can fluctuate. Channel diversity and flexible batch sizing limit downside. Funding timing always carries risk. The January tranche provides buffer, and hiring remains gated.

No risks threaten the company's ability to operate through 2026 under the current plan.

## 8. Definition of Success

Nightjar finishes 2026 with the hard parts behind it. The economics are proven. The operations scale cleanly. Customers buy, deploy, and keep the system running. The company stands on solid ground heading into 2027.

That is the work.
