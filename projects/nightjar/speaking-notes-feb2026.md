# Speaking Notes — CEO Update (30 min)
**Mark Musson | February 11, 2026**

## Opening (2 min)

**The delta since September:**

- Last board: $395K revenue, $468K net loss, cash out by November
- Today: Rio Phase 1 delivered, Phase 2 **confirmed**
- That's not a pilot extension — it's $600K starting July, $250K into 2027
- Total Rio relationship: ~$1.45M
- This is the signal change: proof that TG-4 sells at enterprise scale

**Punch line up front:** We went from survival mode to having a repeatable enterprise customer. Everything else flows from that.

## The Numbers (5 min)

**Revenue transformation:**
- FY25: $395K
- FY26 projected: $1.58M
- That's 4x, driven by one customer buying at scale

**EBIT improvement:**
- FY25: -$468K
- FY26 projected: -$61K
- Not profitable yet, but the gap closed by 87%

**What this means:**
- With Tranche 1 only: funded to July, Rio Phase 2 carries us to Q1 2027
- With Tranche 1 + Tranche 2: funded to profitability
- Without Tranche 1: not relevant — we're oversubscribed at 104%

**Transition:** So the survival question is answered. The growth question depends on Tranche 2.

## Funding Status (8 min)

### Tranche 1: Good News

- Target: $500K
- Committed: $520K
- Close date: Feb 28
- Status: **Oversubscribed**

**The investors:**
- Andrea Chiesi (Ancusa srl): $250K — paperwork pending, this is 48% of the tranche, must close this week
- Seadream Foundation: $200K — existing investor, signed
- Blake Rhodes: $50K — angel via Britt, signed
- George Kelly: $20K — family office, signed

**Critical path:** Andrea's docs. Everything else is done.

### Tranche 2: Reality Check

- Target: $1.5M @ $10M pre-money
- Committed: **$0**
- Days to close: 49

**Pipeline:**
- Two qualified: Tom Keane (warm, via Carly), Pete Cushman (hot, family office, via Carly)
- Nine passed: Counteract, Xplorer, i-XAU, Soros, Aucap, Lexham, Elegant Earth, David Moore, EKA

**What changed:** Rio Phase 2 confirmation. That's the unlock for Tranche 2 conversations.

**The problem:** We need introductions to have those conversations.

**Transition:** Which brings me to what I need from you.

---

## The Ask (3 min)

**Three things:**

1. **Introductions to corporates** — 3-5 intros to mining, energy, infrastructure buyers who think like Rio
2. **Positioning alignment** — We lead with compliance and environmental performance, not conservation storytelling
3. **Air cover** — Quiet reset of 2-3 legacy relationships that no longer fit the enterprise model

**Why this matters:** Rio is proof of concept. Tranche 2 is about finding Rio 2, 3, and 4. I can't do that cold-calling from my network alone.

**Transition:** Let me talk about the commercial side.

## Pipeline Honest Assessment (5 min)

**The numbers:**
- ~20 hard orders
- ~35 near-POs
- ~160 priority from ~280 forecast

**Same as August.** That's not good or bad — it's honest.

**The conversion gap:** Not demand. CRM discipline. Follow-up cadence. Lead nurturing.

**Sales model today:**
- Founder-led (me)
- Richard handling mid-market
- RESOLVE managing conservation pipeline

**That's fine until post-raise.** Then we need structured enterprise sales.

**Why I'm not worried:**
- Rio didn't come from pipeline — it came from a reference
- Enterprise deals don't show up in CRM until they're real
- The TG-4 sells itself once they see it work

**What I am worried about:** We're not set up to scale this yet. That's a post-Tranche 2 problem to solve.

**Transition:** Which connects to team.

---

## Team Needs (4 min)

**Same story as August, now more urgent:**

**Andy:** Carrying product, customer success, and ops. Can't keep doing all three.

**Fergus:** Firmware bottleneck. He's good, but he's one person.

**Post-raise plan:**
- Data scientist
- Data engineer
- Full-stack engineer

**We won't hire ahead of cash.** Tranche 1 doesn't fund hires. Tranche 2 does.

**Fixed costs:** ~$44.5K/month. Disciplined, not desperate.

**Transition:** That's the update. Questions?

---

## Anticipated Questions

**Q: Why is Tranche 2 harder than Tranche 1?**  
A: Tranche 1 was friendly money — existing investors and angels. Tranche 2 is new money at a higher valuation. That requires proof, which we now have with Rio Phase 2.

**Q: What happens if Tranche 2 doesn't close?**  
A: We're funded into Q1 2027 with Tranche 1 + Rio Phase 2 cash. We stay lean, focus on delivery, and raise again in 6-9 months with more revenue proof.

**Q: Is Rio a one-off or repeatable?**  
A: Repeatable. The use case is environmental compliance at industrial sites. Mining, energy, infrastructure all need this. Rio is the reference that opens those doors.

**Q: Why did nine investors pass?**  
A: Half didn't understand the market. Half wanted more traction. Phase 2 confirmation changes that conversation.

**Q: What's the chip order about?**  
A: We need to lock 1,000-unit manufacturing capacity now or lose the slot. Tranche 1 funds the order. It's approved contingent on close.

**Q: Can you do Tranche 2 without board intros?**  
A: Slower. Harder. Probably yes. But why make it harder when the network is sitting in this room?

## Closing (3 min)

**What I said in September:** We need to prove TG-4 sells at enterprise scale.

**What I'm saying today:** We proved it. Rio Phase 2 is that proof.

**What I need from this board:** Help me turn one enterprise customer into ten.

**By next board (May):**
- Rio Phase 2 authorized
- 2-3 additional customers live
- Tranche 1 closed
- Tranche 2 pipeline real

That's the job. Let's do it.
