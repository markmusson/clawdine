# Nightjar Board Meeting — February 11, 2026
**9:00-10:30 AM Eastern | Via Zoom**

## 1. Welcome & Values — Steve D'Esposito (5 min)

Opening remarks and board acknowledgments.

## 2. CEO Update — Mark Musson (30 min)

### Strategic Positioning

**January 2026 plan:** Five priorities — scale production (4 batches, 2,000 units via VVDN), validate unit economics (SaaS margin -69% → 51%), build a real sales engine (787 units), secure $2M SAFE, scale team only when earned (4→6 FTEs after 500 units installed). Revenue target: $992K. Closing cash: $983K. Runway: 18+ months. (Full strategy memo and financial commentary circulated separately.)

**Where we are vs plan:**

Last board: September 2025. FY25 revenue $395K, net loss $468K, cash out by November without funding.

Five months later: Rio Tinto Phase 1 delivered ($601K, 450 units at Simandou), Phase 2 confirmed ($600K from July 2026, $250K carried to 2027). Total Rio relationship: ~$1.45M.

Projected FY26 revenue with Simandou: $1.58M (vs $992K plan, vs $395K FY25). Rio alone exceeds the original revenue target.  
EBIT improvement: -$468K → -$61K projected (vs -$338K plan).

Rio went from important pilot to largest customer, reference account, and proof that TG-4 sells at enterprise scale.

**Plan vs reality scorecard:**

| January Plan | Feb Status | Delta |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue $992K | Tracking $1.58M (Rio) | ↑ 59% above plan |
| 787 units sold | Rio Phase 1: 450 delivered | On track |
| SaaS margin 51% by Dec | Cloud cost compression on track | Per financial commentary |
| $2M SAFE by March | Tranche 1: 104% committed. Tranche 2: $0 | ⚠️ Behind |
| Team 4→6 after 500 units | Still at 4. Correct per plan. | ✓ |
| EBIT -$338K | Tracking -$61K | ↑ Significantly better |
| Closing cash $983K | Dependent on Tranche 2 | See scenarios |

### Operational Highlights

**Product:**
- TG-4 shipping at $799, positioned mid-market between Bushnell ($100-300) and Reconyx ($1,300-5,000)
- OTA updates live, compliance toggle deployed
- SpeciesNet integration ready for launch

**Technology:**
- Darwin/Anguilla biosecurity pilot operational, donor-funded via RESOLVE
- Firmware roadmap on track, bottleneck remains Fergus capacity

**Sales:**
- Founder-led + Richard + RESOLVE
- Pipeline: ~20 hard orders, ~35 near-POs, ~160 priority from ~280 forecast
- Conversion gap is ops/CRM discipline, not demand
- Need: structured enterprise sales post-raise

### Lighthouse Projects

**Rio Tinto Simandou:**
- Phase 1: 450 units deployed, $601K contracted, delivered
- Phase 2: $600K confirmed from July 2026, $250K in 2027
- Use case: environmental compliance monitoring at mining site
- Significance: repeatable enterprise model, reference for similar buyers

**Darwin/Anguilla:**
- Biosecurity pilot in Caribbean
- Donor-funded via RESOLVE
- Proof of TG-4 application beyond conservation

### Resourcing

**Current bottlenecks:**
- Andy: overloaded across product, customer success, and ops
- Fergus: firmware development single point of failure

**Post-raise hires (dependent on Tranche 2):**
- Data scientist
- Data engineer
- Full-stack engineer

**Fixed costs:** ~$44.5K/month

No hires ahead of cash.

## 3. Technology Update — Andy Lee (10 min)

- OTA update capability deployed and tested
- Compliance toggle feature live (critical for Rio Phase 2)
- SpeciesNet ML integration ready
- Firmware roadmap: next release targets multi-site sync
- Technical debt manageable, scaling requires data engineering capacity

---

## 4. Pipeline Update — Mark Musson (5 min)

| Category | Units | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Hard orders | ~20 | Ready to fulfill |
| Near-PO | ~35 | 30-60 day close window |
| Priority | ~160 | Qualified from 280 forecast |

**Conversion challenge:** Not demand. CRM discipline and follow-up cadence.

**Sales model:** Founder-led until post-raise. Richard handling mid-market, RESOLVE managing conservation pipeline.

**Target accounts:** Mining, energy, infrastructure — buyers who need compliance documentation, not conservation storytelling.

## 5. Financials — Kalkidan Smith (10 min)

### FY25 Actual vs FY26 Plan vs FY26 Projected

| Metric | FY25 Actual | FY26 Plan (Jan) | FY26 Projected |
|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue | $395K | $992K | $1.58M |
| EBIT | -$468K | -$338K | -$61K |
| Blended gross margin | — | ~50% | ~50% |
| Cash runway | Breach Nov 2025 | 18+ months | Funded into 2027* |

*With Tranche 1 closed + Rio Phase 2 cash from July

### Unit Economics Trajectory (from Jan financial commentary)

| Metric | Jan 2026 | Jun 2026 | Dec 2026 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Installed base | 51 | 330 | 785 |
| Cloud cost/unit | $84.59 | $35.69 | $24.34 |
| SaaS gross margin | -69% | 29% | 51% |
| Contribution/unit | -$34.59 | $14.31 | $25.66 |

This is the core thesis: fixed infrastructure costs amortise across units. Each camera makes every other camera more profitable. December targets (cloud <$25/unit, SaaS margin >51%) are validated against actual GCP billing, not projections.

### Hardware Unit Economics

| Component | Cost/Unit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| VVDN BOM + Assembly | $233 | Validated across 3 production runs |
| Freight + Duty + Insurance | $70 | Landed cost |
| Warranty reserve | $20 | 2.5% of ASP |
| Contingency buffer | $115 | Conservative |
| **Total COGS/unit** | **$438** | **45% gross margin at $799 ASP** |

### Revenue Composition (FY26 Plan)

| Stream | Amount | Mix | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hardware | $629K | 63% | 787 units @ $799 ASP |
| SaaS (Recurring) | $230K | 23% | 785 base × $50/mo ARPU; compounds throughout year |
| Services | $133K | 13% | Deployment + support |
| **Total** | **$992K** | | SaaS grows to 34% in 2027, 45% in 2028 |

### Quarterly Revenue Progression (Plan)

| Quarter | Revenue | Units Sold | Installed Base | QoQ Growth |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | $167K | 158 | 158 | — |
| Q2 | $207K | 172 | 330 | 24% |
| Q3 | $267K | 203 | 533 | 29% |
| Q4 | $352K | 254 | 785 | 32% |

Q4 revenue more than doubles Q1, driven by compounding SaaS subscriptions.

### Use of Funds (Tranche 1 + Tranche 2)

| Category | Allocation | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Chips/Manufacturing | 40% | 1,000-unit production run |
| Working capital | 25% | Bridge to positive cash flow |
| Platform & ML | 15% | Data engineering, SpeciesNet |
| Field ops | 12% | Customer success, deployment |
| Contingency | 8% | Risk buffer |

### Cash Flow (Plan, with $2M SAFE)

| Quarter | Opening | Funding | Operating | Production | Closing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | $165K | $2,000K | -$102K | -$202K | $1,862K |
| Q2 | $1,862K | — | -$98K | -$156K | $1,607K |
| Q3 | $1,607K | — | -$77K | -$219K | $1,311K |
| Q4 | $1,311K | — | -$109K | -$219K | $983K |

Cash profile designed to be boring. No cliff edges. No dependency on future fundraising to complete the year.

### OpEx Discipline

| Category | FY2026 | % of OpEx |
|---|---|---|
| Salaries & Benefits | $647K | 78% |
| Accounting & Legal | $48K | 6% |
| Marketing | $30K | 4% |
| Other | $105K | 13% |
| **Total** | **$830K** | |

OpEx as % of revenue falls from 109% in Q1 to 72% in Q4. Not cost cutting — leverage. The cost base was built for a larger business.

### Scenarios

**Scenario A:** Tranche 1 only ($520K)  
- Cash runway to July 2026
- Rio Phase 2 cash extends to Q1 2027
- Limited hiring, ops-focused

**Scenario B:** Tranche 1 + Tranche 2 ($2.02M)  
- Production scaled to 1,000 units
- Three hires (data scientist, data engineer, full-stack)
- Platform development funded
- Runway to profitability
- Closing cash $983K, 18+ months runway

**Scenario C:** Neither tranche  
- Breach March 2026
- Not relevant (Tranche 1 oversubscribed)
