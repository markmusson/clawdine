# Backbone — February 11, 2026 Board Meeting
**The 5 messages that must land, regardless of how the conversation flows.**

---

## 1. We Proved the Model

Rio Tinto went from 30-unit pilot to 450 deployed, Phase 1 delivered at $601K, Phase 2 confirmed at $600K starting July. Total relationship: ~$1.45M.

**This is not a pilot.** This is a customer buying at enterprise scale because TG-4 solves a compliance problem they can't solve any other way.

**Signal change:** From "interesting hardware startup" to "repeatable enterprise revenue model."

---

## 2. Survival Is Solved, Growth Is Not

With Tranche 1 ($520K, oversubscribed) + Rio Phase 2 cash: funded into Q1 2027.

Without additional funding, we stay lean, deliver on Rio, and prove unit economics. That's fine.

**But Tranche 2 ($1.5M) is the difference between:**
- Staying small and profitable
- Scaling production and becoming the category leader

Tranche 2 is about ambition, not survival.

## 3. Tranche 2 Needs This Board's Network

Zero committed with 49 days to close.

Two qualified leads (Tom Keane, Pete Cushman, both via Carly). Nine passed.

**The problem is not the product or the valuation.** The problem is we don't have enough at-bats.

**What unlocks Tranche 2:** Introductions to 3-5 corporates in mining, energy, infrastructure who buy like Rio. Buyers who understand compliance-led environmental monitoring.

**This board has that network.** I need you to deploy it.

## 4. We Sell Compliance, Not Conservation

TG-4 positioned mid-market: $799, between Bushnell ($100-300) and Reconyx ($1,300-5,000).

**The enterprise buyer doesn't care about saving species.** They care about:
- Meeting regulatory requirements
- Documenting environmental impact
- Avoiding fines and delays

Rio bought because TG-4 gives them audit-ready data. That's the story for mining, energy, infrastructure.

**Conservation is a use case, not the positioning.** Board alignment on this matters for Tranche 2 intros.

---

## 5. Execution Is Constrained by People, Not Product

Product works. OTA updates live. Compliance toggle deployed. SpeciesNet ready. TG-4 ships and performs.

**Bottlenecks:**
- Andy overloaded (product + customer success + ops)
- Fergus single point of failure on firmware
- No structured enterprise sales yet

**Post-raise plan:** Data scientist, data engineer, full-stack. We won't hire ahead of cash.

**The point:** Product execution is not the risk. Team capacity is. Tranche 2 funds the team that scales this.

---

## Summary

**If they remember nothing else:**

1. Rio Phase 2 = proof of enterprise repeatability
2. Survival solved, growth depends on Tranche 2
3. Tranche 2 needs board introductions to corporates
4. We sell compliance, not conservation
5. Product works, team needs scaling

**The meta-message:** We did what we said we'd do. Now we need the board's network to do what comes next.
