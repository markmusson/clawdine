# Leading an Outstanding Therapy Service: Vision, Strategy and Impact at Great Oaks College

**10-minute presentation — slide content + speaker notes**

## SLIDE 1: My Vision for an Integrated Therapy Service

**On slide:**
- Embedded throughout the day — not a pull-out service
- Focussed on both students AND staff
- Present in every area: classroom, leisure, work experience
- Strengths-focussed: what students CAN do, not just what they struggle with
- Practical tools and strategies for health, wellbeing, and independence

**Speaker notes (~2 mins):**
My vision is a therapy service that's woven into the fabric of the college day. Not a separate department students get referred to — a team that's visible, present, and working alongside teaching and support staff in every setting.

An integrated team — OT, Speech and Language, Physio — brings different lenses to the same student. OT sees sensory and functional needs. SaLT sees communication barriers. Physio sees motor challenges. Together, we see the whole young person: emotional, physical, and social development as one picture.

Using the PEO framework — Person, Environment, Occupation — we can identify what's getting in the way of a student's participation and learning, and work collaboratively to change the environment, build the skills, or both.

Critically, this is strengths-focussed. We're not cataloguing deficits. We're identifying what each student brings and building on it to develop independence, endurance, and confidence.

## SLIDE 2: Developing the Service — First 12-18 Months

**On slide:**

**Foundations (Months 1-3)**
- Clinical governance: EHCP compliance, risk assessments, safeguarding clarity
- Audit current provision: what's working, what's missing, where are the gaps?
- Clinical supervision structures in place — staff feel heard and supported

**Build (Months 4-9)**
- Therapists embedded in classrooms and enrichment areas
- IEPs and target tracking updated termly, aligned to EHCP outcomes
- Training programme launched: upskilling teachers and support staff
- Student voice: ensuring young people are heard, supported, and advocated for

**Embed (Months 10-18)**
- Evidence impact: termly reviews, annual reviews, behaviour tracking
- Strategies embedded across the curriculum as standard practice
- Transition support: working with job coaches and community partners
- Work experience and activity analysis — skills taught on the job where possible

**Speaker notes (~4 mins):**
The first three months are about foundations. You can't build an outstanding service on shaky governance. I'd start with a thorough audit — are EHCPs being read and adhered to? Are risk assessments and safeguarding protocols clear? Where are the training gaps? I'd establish clinical supervision immediately so the team feels supported and has a safe space to reflect on practice.

From months four to nine, it's about being visible and useful. Therapists spending time in classrooms and enrichment areas, not waiting in therapy rooms for referrals. When you're present, you can identify sensory, physical, and communication needs in real time and recommend strategies that staff can implement immediately. Collaborative problem-solving with the student and their team, in context.

I'd launch a structured training programme — sharing tools and techniques with teaching assistants, teachers, and support staff. The goal is therapeutic thinking that continues when the therapist isn't in the room. That's how you scale impact.

Student voice matters enormously. Young people need to be heard and advocated for, not just assessed. They are experts in their own experience.

By months ten to eighteen, we should see strategies becoming embedded practice, not special interventions. Impact is evidenced through EHCP target tracking, termly and annual reviews, and behaviour data. We can show what's working and adjust what isn't.

Transition support is critical — working with job coaches, community links, and employers to ensure skills developed at college transfer into real-world settings. Activity analysis for work experience placements, teaching skills on the job where possible.

## SLIDE 3: Ensuring High-Quality, Student-Centred Practice

**On slide:**
- Right people: rigorous recruitment — skills, compassion, motivation to work with young people with high needs
- Right support: thorough induction, ongoing CPD, regular supervision
- Right culture: modelling best practice, openness to feedback, reflective practice
- Right focus: always the student. Every decision, every strategy, every conversation comes back to outcomes for young people

**Speaker notes (~3 mins):**
Quality starts with recruitment. Finding people with the right clinical skills is necessary but not sufficient. You need people with genuine compassion and motivation to work with young people with complex needs. That's not trainable — you either have it or you don't. I'd be rigorous about this.

Once you have the right people, you invest in them. A thorough induction that sets expectations clearly. Ongoing training that builds confidence and competence. Regular clinical supervision — not just a tick-box exercise but a genuine space for reflection, challenge, and growth.

I believe in modelling. If I'm asking the team to be student-centred, I need to be in classrooms myself. If I'm asking for openness to feedback, I need to actively seek it. The culture of a therapy team is set by its leader — through what you do, not what you put in a policy document.

And the non-negotiable: every decision comes back to the student. Not the timetable, not the paperwork, not the convenience of the service. What does this young person need to participate, communicate, and progress? That's the question. Everything else is logistics.

## SLIDE 4: Summary

**On slide:**
- Therapy embedded in college life, not bolted on
- Strengths-focussed, collaborative, evidence-based
- First 12-18 months: govern, build, embed
- Quality through people, culture, and relentless student focus

**Speaker notes (~1 min):**
An outstanding therapy service isn't about having therapists in a building. It's about having therapeutic thinking in every room. My vision for Great Oaks is a team that's embedded, collaborative, strengths-focussed, and always — always — led by what's best for the student.

Thank you. I'm happy to take questions.

**Presentation tips for Gail:**
- 10 minutes = roughly 1,200-1,500 spoken words. This script is within that.
- Don't read from slides — slides are headlines, you provide the substance.
- The PEO framework reference shows clinical credibility. Use it early.
- "Student voice" and "advocacy" are strong themes for a college setting — panels love hearing it.
- If asked about challenges: be honest about governance taking time, but frame it as "getting foundations right."
- Close with confidence. The last thing they hear matters most.
