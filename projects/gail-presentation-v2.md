## SLIDE 1: My Vision for an Integrated Therapy Service

**On slide:**
- Embedded throughout the day, focussed on students' strengths
- Supporting students AND staff across every setting — classroom, leisure, work
- Strengths-focussed: building on what students can do
- Practical, achievable tools and strategies for health, wellbeing and independence

**Speaker notes:**
My vision is a therapy service that isn't bolted on — it's embedded. Present throughout the day, in every environment. Not waiting for referrals in a therapy room, but working alongside students and staff where learning and life actually happen.

Using the PEO framework — Person, Environment, Occupation — an integrated team of OT, Speech and Language, and Physio can assess, identify strengths as well as barriers to learning, and look at the underlying reasons for difficulties. Strategies to support emotional, physical and social development. Working collaboratively with teachers and support staff, we can address issues as they arise, problem-solve together with the student, and proactively reduce difficulties and dysregulation.

## SLIDE 2: Development and Leadership — First 12-18 Months

**On slide:**
- Get to know the students and staff — and them to know me
- Build trust through presence: observations, time in class, activities alongside staff
- Meet everyone: SLT, MLT, Teachers, LSAs, TAs, Therapy staff
- Review therapy team, caseload, documentation, referrals, networking
- Audit current practice, environment, assessments, resources and relationships

**Speaker notes:**
The first thing I'd do is listen. Get to know the students, get to know the staff, and let them get to know me. You can't lead a team you haven't earned the trust of.

That means spending time in classrooms and activities, observing, understanding how things work now before proposing how they should change. Meeting with every discipline — SLT, MLT, teachers, LSAs, TAs, the therapy team. Reviewing caseloads, documentation, referral pathways. Understanding the current environment, assessments, resources, and relationships.

You build trust first. Everything else follows from that.

## SLIDE 3: Clinical Governance

**On slide:**
- Risk assessments current and reviewed
- Safeguarding protocols clear and adhered to
- EHCP provision: read, understood, and delivered
- Medical documents up to date
- Goal setting, tracking, and regular updating
- Staff training and CPD programme
- Clinical supervision — staff voices heard
- Student voices heard: encouraged to engage in their plans and advocate for themselves

**Speaker notes:**
Governance is the foundation. If EHCPs aren't being read and adhered to, nothing else works. I'd audit the current state: are risk assessments current? Is safeguarding clear? Are medical documents up to date?

Then build the structures: goal setting and tracking that's reviewed regularly, not just at annual review. A staff training and CPD programme. Clinical supervision that's genuinely supportive — where staff feel heard, not just managed.

And critically — student voice. Young people should be encouraged to engage in their own plans and advocate for themselves. They are experts in their own experience.

## SLIDE 4: Evidencing Impact of the Therapy Team

**On slide:**
- EHCPs: checking targets and outcomes are being addressed and updated
- IEPs updated termly
- Tracking tools and behaviour monitoring
- Termly and annual reviews — demonstrating progress
- Students Causing Concern meetings (RAG)
- Staff approaching therapy team proactively for advice
- Strategies and tools implemented throughout the college
- Staff making links between activities and benefit (e.g. physical exercise → emotional regulation)
- Short therapy contributions to school reports

**Speaker notes:**
Impact has to be visible and measurable. That starts with EHCPs — are the targets being addressed? Are outcomes being updated? IEPs reviewed termly, not annually.

But evidence isn't just paperwork. It's also culture change. When staff start approaching the therapy team proactively for advice — that's evidence. When a teacher connects physical exercise to emotional regulation without being prompted — that's evidence. When strategies you introduced appear across the college in classrooms you've never visited — that's the service working.

Tracking tools, behaviour data, termly reviews, annual reviews, RAG-rated concern meetings — all feed into a picture of impact that you can present to governors, parents, and inspectors.

## SLIDE 5: Embedding Strategies Across the Curriculum

**On slide:**
- Collaborative working: present in class, participate in activities alongside students and staff
- Work together with other members of the therapy team
- Share best practice — ensure staff understand the value of therapy
- Universal, targeted, and specialist support (tiered approach)
- Bite-size, practical toolboxes: easy wins staff can implement immediately (e.g. exercise routines)
- Ask for feedback: what's working, what isn't, adapt
- Show flexibility and openness to change
- Assess, review, refine

**Speaker notes:**
Embedding means the strategies outlive you. If it only works when the therapist is in the room, it's not embedded.

I'd use a tiered approach — universal strategies that benefit everyone, targeted support for students who need more, and specialist input for complex needs. The goal is equipping staff with practical, bite-size tools they can use immediately. Not a 40-page document — a laminated card, a visual routine, a five-minute exercise.

Collaborative working is key. I'd be present in classrooms and activities, modelling, working alongside staff and students. Then asking: what's working? What isn't? And adapting. Flexibility and openness to change aren't weaknesses — they're how you build trust with a teaching team.

## SLIDE 6: Supporting Transitions into the Community or Work Settings

**On slide:**
- Review transition documents and update when indicated
- Risk assessments updated with individual strengths and areas of concern
- Review activities on-site: how do skills developed transfer to community and work?
- Task analysis for work experience placements
- Review opportunities outside college and in the local area
- Work together with teachers, job coaches, external providers
- Support work experience: skills taught on the job where possible

**Speaker notes:**
Transition is where therapy meets real life. The question isn't just "can this student do this task in college?" — it's "can they do it in a workplace, in their community, independently?"

Task analysis is powerful here. Breaking down work experience placements into component skills, identifying what's already in place and what needs support. Working with job coaches and external providers to ensure the transition plan is realistic and the student is set up to succeed, not just placed and hoped for.

Reviewing what opportunities exist locally, building relationships with employers, and ensuring risk assessments reflect the individual — their strengths as well as their areas of concern.

## SLIDE 7: Key Priorities for Supporting Staff and Building Capacity

**On slide:**

**Building capacity:**
- Consider a Wellbeing Lead and peer mentors
- Use LSAs and TAs to roll out initiatives and reinforce strategies in class

**Removing barriers to direct therapy:**
- Reduce admin time — streamline tools and reporting
- Play to individuals' strengths within the team
- Improve feedback, debrief, and support structures
- Recognise contributions and progress (e.g. Kanban board for visibility)

**Speaker notes:**
If we want therapists doing therapy, we need to remove the barriers that stop them. Admin time is the biggest one. Streamlining reporting tools and documentation frees up clinical hours.

Building capacity means thinking beyond the therapy team. A Wellbeing Lead, peer mentors among students, LSAs and TAs trained to reinforce strategies in class — that extends the reach of every therapist.

Playing to strengths within the team matters too. Not everyone excels at the same thing. And recognising contributions — something as simple as a Kanban board that makes progress visible — keeps morale up and shows the team their work matters.

Inadequate debrief is a retention risk. Staff working with high-needs young people need proper support, not just a "how was your day" in the corridor.

## SLIDE 8: Ensuring High-Quality, Student-Centred Practice Across the Multidisciplinary Team

**On slide:**
- Rigorous recruitment: right skills, compassion, and motivation to work with young people with high needs
- Thorough induction training
- Ongoing training, supervision, and reinforcing values
- Debriefing: proper support for staff working with complex needs
- Modelling: lead by example
- Neuro-affirming approach throughout

**Speaker notes:**
Quality starts with who you hire. Clinical skills are necessary but not sufficient — you need people with genuine compassion and motivation to work with young people with complex needs. That's not trainable.

Induction sets the standard. Ongoing supervision reinforces it. And modelling is everything — if I'm asking the team to be student-centred, I need to be visibly student-centred myself. Every day.

A neuro-affirming approach is non-negotiable. We're not trying to make neurodivergent students look neurotypical. We're adapting the environment, the communication, and the expectations to meet the student where they are. That's the difference between compliance and genuine inclusion.

Thank you. I'm happy to take questions.
