# Roundy Pricing Research — Feb 13, 2026

## Competitive Landscape Pricing

| Tool | Type | Pricing | Notes |
|------|------|---------|-------|
| **Affinity** | Relationship CRM (investor-side) | $2,000–$2,700/year ($167–$225/mo) | Enterprise-focused, VC/PE firms |
| **Attio** | Flexible CRM | Free (3 seats), $29/user/mo, $59/user/mo Pro, $119/user/mo Enterprise | General purpose, not fundraising-specific |
| **Fundingstack** | Fundraising CRM (VC/banker side) | $250/user/month | Unlimited deals, investor DB access |
| **Foundersuite** | Founder fundraising platform | Free (basic), $745/year (~$62/mo) Silver, Gold/Platinum higher | 100K+ startups, DB of 227K investors |
| **Visible.vc** | Investor updates/reporting | Free starter, paid tiers (unconfirmed exact pricing) | Post-raise focused, not active fundraising |
| **Boardy** | AI networking/introductions | Free (appears to be) | Andrew D'Souza, Clearco co-founder. $3M pre-seed + $8M round |

## Key Observations

1. **No free tier in the direct comp set that offers AI.** Foundersuite free = pipeline only, no AI. Attio free = 3 seats, basic CRM. The AI features are always gated behind paid.

2. **$50-$250/mo is the range** for serious fundraising tooling. Fundingstack at $250/user/mo proves willingness to pay at the high end. Foundersuite at $62/mo is the floor.

3. **73% of SaaS tools raised prices in 2025.** Market is moving up, not down.

4. **Founders raising $1-10M rounds** don't blink at $100-200/mo. They're spending $500/mo on lawyers, $200/mo on accounting, $50/mo on pitch deck tools. A tool that saves one lost deal pays for itself 1000x.

5. **The "intelligence" premium is real.** Affinity charges $200/mo+ for relationship intelligence. Roundy's pitch scoring + daily recommendations + adversarial validation is a higher-value intelligence layer.

## Pricing Recommendation

### Kill the free tier
- Free tier attracts tyre-kickers, not fundraising founders
- Costs AI inference with no revenue
- Creates support burden from non-paying users
- 14-day free trial on Pro is sufficient to prove value
- Anyone serious about raising a round will pay $100/mo without thinking

### New pricing structure

| Plan | Price | Target | Key differentiator |
|------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| **Pro** | $119/month | Solo founders actively raising | Full AI: daily recommendations, pitch scoring, meeting prep, chat, adversarial validation |
| **Team** | $249/month (includes 3 seats, +$59/additional seat) | Multi-founder teams, advisors | Everything in Pro + shared pipeline, team collaboration, role-based access |
| **Accelerator** | Custom (starting $2,000/mo) | Accelerators, studios, VCs managing portfolio fundraising | Multi-workspace, portfolio analytics, batch onboarding, API access |

### Why $119 not $99
- $99 signals "cheap tool." $119 signals "professional tool with premium pricing"
- At $119, the math is: one saved deal interaction pays for 10 years of Roundy
- Psychological: $119 is "considered purchase" territory — users who pay this much actually use the product (higher retention)
- Annual discount: $99/mo billed annually ($1,188/year) — gives you the $99 price point for committed users

### Why $249 for Team
- 3 included seats at ~$83/seat is competitive with Attio Pro ($59) but includes domain-specific AI
- $59/additional seat matches Attio exactly — familiar price point
- Team plan at 2x solo is standard SaaS multiplier
- Most fundraising teams are 2-3 people (founder + co-founder + maybe CFO/advisor)

### Accelerator tier
- This is the Boardy co-launch angle: accelerators use Boardy for intros, Roundy for pipeline management
- $2,000/mo starting is below Affinity ($2,700/year ≈ $225/mo but per user, teams of 10+ = $2,250+/mo)
- Custom pricing lets you anchor high and negotiate

## Revised Unit Economics

| Metric | Old ($49 Pro) | New ($119 Pro) |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| ARPU | $49/mo | ~$140/mo (blended Pro + Team) |
| CAC | $45 | $65 (higher touch, higher quality) |
| LTV | $470 | $1,344 (9.6 months × $140) |
| LTV/CAC | 10.4x | 20.7x |
| Gross margin | 78% | 82% (AI cost is fixed per interaction, higher revenue dilutes it) |

## Path to $1M ARR

| Scenario | Users needed | Timeline |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Old ($49/mo) | 1,701 Pro users | 18 months |
| New ($119/mo Pro only) | 700 Pro users | 12 months |
| New (blended $140/mo) | 595 paying accounts | 10 months |
| New + Accelerator tier | ~500 accounts + 5 accelerators | 8 months |

## SOM Revision

Old SOM (Year 3): $12M ARR = 20,000 users at $49/month
New SOM (Year 3): $12M ARR = 7,143 users at $140/month (blended)

Fewer users, same revenue, better support economics, higher quality customer base.
