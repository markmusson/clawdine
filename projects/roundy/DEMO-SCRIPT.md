## Demo Sequence (18 minutes)

### Act 1: The Morning (Jobs 1, 2, 4) — 5 minutes

**Scene: Sarah opens Roundy to start her day.**

---

**DEMO PRESENTER**: Sarah is raising a $750K pre-seed round for RouteStack. She has 12 active investor conversations and three meetings this week. Let's see what her morning looks like with Roundy.

*[Opens roundy.ai → Today page]*

**PRESENTER**: This is the Today page. It's Sarah's war room. Three things to notice.

*[Points to "The Move" card at the top]*

**PRESENTER**: First — The Move. Roundy has analyzed Sarah's entire pipeline and determined the single highest-leverage action for today.

*[Reads the card]*

> **The Move: Send the signed SAFE to David Moore at Horizon Ventures**
>
> Focus: Round acceleration
>
> David verbally committed $150K on Friday's call but you haven't sent docs. He responds to messages within 4 hours on average. Every day without docs is a day he could cool off.
>
> Evidence: [Friday call transcript] [David's response pattern: 4hr avg] [$150K committed, no paperwork]

**PRESENTER**: Notice this isn't "follow up with investors." It's a specific action, with a specific investor, backed by specific evidence. Roundy computed this from every interaction Sarah has ever logged — David's response latency, his commitment language from Friday's transcript, and the risk of delay.

Sarah can click any evidence card to see the source interaction. She can also click "Draft Email" to generate a follow-up referencing Friday's call.

*[Scrolls to Today's Briefing]*

**PRESENTER**: Second — the daily briefing. Roundy categorizes her pipeline activity.

*[Points to "Stalled" section]*

> **Stalled: Andrea Kim (Apex Capital) — 11 days silent**
>
> Last contact: Feb 1. Andrea asked about unit economics and Sarah promised to send a financial model. The model was never sent. Andrea's typical response pattern is 2-3 days.
>
> Suggested action: Send the financial model with a note acknowledging the delay.

**PRESENTER**: Roundy caught something Sarah probably forgot. She promised Andrea a financial model 11 days ago and never sent it. That's not in a spreadsheet or a to-do list — Roundy extracted it from the transcript of their February 1st call.

*[Points to "Hot" section]*

> **Hot: Emma Wilson (Founders Fund) — Momentum building**
>
> Requested data room yesterday. Has responded within 24 hours to every message. Conviction score: 7/10, up from 4/10 three weeks ago. She's a fast mover — this deal could close this week.

**PRESENTER**: And here's the counterpoint — Emma is the hottest lead in the pipeline. Her conviction score has nearly doubled. Roundy tracks this through behavioral signals: response speed, meeting frequency, the language she uses. Not what Sarah thinks is happening — what the data shows.

*[Points to Upcoming Meetings]*

**PRESENTER**: Third — three meetings this week. Each one has a "Prep" button that generates a full briefing. We'll use that in a moment.

---

### Act 2: Understanding the Pipeline (Job 4) — 3 minutes

**Scene: Sarah switches to the Pipeline view to see the full picture.**

---

*[Clicks "Pipeline" in sidebar]*

**PRESENTER**: This is the pipeline board. Seven stages, drag and drop. The metrics bar at the top shows Sarah has raised $290K of her $750K target — 39% of the way there with 45 days until her target close.

*[Points to the deal cards]*

**PRESENTER**: Each card shows the investor, their firm, the check size range, days since last contact, and a health indicator. Green means momentum. Yellow means watch it. Red means risk.

*[Points to David Moore card in "Committed" column — green]*

**PRESENTER**: David is green. He committed Friday. As The Move told us, Sarah needs to send docs before he cools off.

*[Points to Andrea Kim card in "Pitching" column — red]*

**PRESENTER**: Andrea is red. Eleven days silent after Sarah failed to deliver a promised document. This is a real risk — not because Andrea isn't interested, but because Sarah dropped the ball.

*[Points to a new card in "Sourced" column]*

**PRESENTER**: And here's a new warm intro from yesterday — Tom Liu via Sarah's advisor. He's in Sourced because they haven't had a real conversation yet.

*[Hovers over Deal Proposals widget]*

**PRESENTER**: Roundy also suggests stage changes when the evidence supports it.

> **Proposed: Move Emma Wilson from Pitching → In DD**
>
> Reason: Requested data room, asked detailed financial questions, scheduled partner meeting. Confidence: High.

**PRESENTER**: Sarah can approve this with one click, or dismiss it. Roundy never moves a deal without her approval.

---

### Act 3: Pitch Intelligence (Jobs 3, 7) — 4 minutes

**Scene: Sarah reviews her pitch performance after two analyzed sessions.**

---

*[Clicks "Analysis" in sidebar]*

**PRESENTER**: This is Pitch Intelligence. Sarah has analyzed two pitch transcripts so far. Let's see what the AI found.

*[Points to score section]*

**PRESENTER**: Her overall pitch score is 72 out of 100. Clarity is strong at 81 — investors understand what RouteStack does. But structure is weaker at 64 — her narrative doesn't close the loop on why this is investable now.

*[Points to "What Lands" section]*

**PRESENTER**: Across both pitches, two things consistently land: her technical background in logistics AI, and her traction numbers — 3 paying pilots. These are her strengths. She should lead with them.

*[Points to "What Misses" section]*

**PRESENTER**: And two things consistently miss: unit economics explanation and competitive moat. Both investors asked follow-up questions that Sarah couldn't fully answer.

This is the pattern detection at work. It's not about one meeting — it's about what's repeating.

*[Points to Objections section]*

**PRESENTER**: The objections panel shows "Burn rate" was raised in both meetings. Sarah can click to see exactly who said what.

*[Clicks on "Burn rate" objection]*

> **Raised by: Andrea Kim (Feb 1)**
> "Your burn rate at $80K/month gives you 9 months of runway. That's tight for getting to Series A metrics."
>
> **Raised by: Blake Rhodes (Jan 28)**
> "What happens if you don't close the round in the next 60 days? Your cash position concerns me."

**PRESENTER**: Two different investors, same concern. Now Sarah can prepare a response and never get caught off guard by this question again.

*[Clicks "Generate FAQ" button]*

**PRESENTER**: Roundy generates a draft response she can refine and use in future pitches. After five or more sessions, the pattern detection becomes very powerful — it shows you exactly where you're improving and where you're stuck.

---

### Act 4: Meeting Prep (Job 5) — 3 minutes

**Scene: Sarah has a call with Tom Liu (new warm intro) tomorrow. She preps.**

---

*[Goes back to Today page → clicks "Prep" on Tom Liu meeting]*

**PRESENTER**: Sarah has a call with Tom Liu at Pinnacle Capital tomorrow at 2 PM. She's never spoken to him before — this is a warm intro from her advisor.

*[Meeting Prep dialog opens, shows loading, then displays briefing]*

**PRESENTER**: In about 10 seconds, Roundy generates a full briefing.

> **Tom Liu — Partner, Pinnacle Capital**
>
> **Background**: Pre-seed/seed focus, infrastructure and developer tools. Recent investments include LogDNA (Series A, $20M) and PipelineAI (Seed, $3M). Based in SF. Previously VP Eng at Stripe.
>
> **Suggested Angle**: Lead with the technical architecture. Tom has an engineering background and his portfolio skews toward technical infrastructure plays. RouteStack's AI routing engine maps directly to his thesis.
>
> **Objections to Prepare For**:
> - May ask about enterprise sales cycle (his portfolio companies sell to developers, not enterprise logistics teams)
> - Likely to probe on data moat (how does the routing model improve with usage?)
>
> **Talking Points**:
> 1. Open with the scale of the problem ($240B US freight market, 30% inefficiency in last-mile routing)
> 2. Demo the routing optimization engine (visual before/after)
> 3. Address unit economics proactively — show the path from pilot to contract
>
> **Questions to Ask Tom**:
> - "What's your typical timeline from first meeting to term sheet?"
> - "Are you leading or following at this stage?"

**PRESENTER**: This is synthesized from web research, Roundy's knowledge of investor types, and Sarah's own pitch history. The talking points address her known weaknesses — unit economics and competitive moat — tailored to what this specific investor cares about.

Sarah can share this briefing with her co-founder, export it as a PDF, or just review it on her phone before the call.

---

### Act 5: Processing an Interaction (Jobs 6, 8) — 3 minutes

**Scene: Sarah just finished her call with Tom. She uploads the transcript.**

---

*[Opens Command Palette: Cmd+K → "Process transcript"]*

**PRESENTER**: Sarah's call with Tom just ended. Granola synced the transcript automatically. She clicks "Process" in her inbox.

*[Shows processing animation — about 30 seconds in real time, fast-forwarded in demo]*

**PRESENTER**: Roundy processes the transcript and extracts structured data.

> **Interaction: Call with Tom Liu (Pinnacle Capital)**
>
> **Heat**: Leaning in (positive signals detected)
>
> **Commitment likelihood**: 6/10
>
> **What landed**:
> - Technical architecture explanation — Tom asked detailed follow-up questions (positive engagement signal)
> - Traction numbers — "3 paying pilots in 8 weeks is impressive for pre-seed"
>
> **What missed**:
> - Enterprise sales motion — Tom expressed uncertainty about logistics buyer persona
>
> **Objections raised**:
> - "How do you compete with Route4Me and OptimoRoute?"
>
> **Action items**:
> - [Sarah] Send competitive landscape one-pager by Thursday
> - [Tom] "I'll talk to my partner about this on Monday"
>
> **Prediction**: Likely to continue → next step is partner meeting

**PRESENTER**: In 30 seconds, that raw transcript became a structured interaction with sentiment, signals, objections, action items, and a prediction. The deal card for Tom moves from Sourced to Qualified. A task is created: "Send competitive landscape one-pager to Tom by Thursday."

*[Clicks "Draft Email" on the action item]*

**PRESENTER**: And Sarah can immediately draft a follow-up.

> **Subject**: Great chat today — competitive landscape doc incoming
>
> **Body**: Tom, thanks for the conversation. I could tell the routing engine architecture resonated — happy to go deeper on the technical side with your partner when you're ready.
>
> You asked about how we differentiate from Route4Me and OptimoRoute. I'm putting together a one-pager that covers this — will have it to you by Thursday.
>
> Looking forward to the partner conversation.
>
> Best, Sarah

**PRESENTER**: The email references specific points from today's call — the routing engine, the competitive question, Tom's mention of his partner. Sarah reviews, edits if needed, and sends. The whole process — transcript to follow-up email — took under two minutes.

---

### Closing: The Compound Effect — 1 minute

---

**PRESENTER**: That's one day. Now imagine 60 days of this.

After 60 interactions, Roundy has built a complete context graph of Sarah's fundraise. It knows which investors respond fast and which ghost. It knows what pitch points land with VCs versus angels. It knows that Andrea needs a financial model, David needs docs, Emma is ready to close, and Tom is worth pursuing.

Every morning: one recommendation, backed by evidence. Every transcript: scored, structured, and stored. Every follow-up: drafted from real conversation context.

The result: Sarah doesn't lose deals because she forgot a follow-up. She doesn't waste time on polite maybes. She focuses her energy on the conversations that actually move the round forward.

That's Roundy. The fundraising OS that tells you what to do next.

## Demo Environment Notes

**To reset the demo environment:**
1. Use the pre-loaded demo workspace with Sarah's pipeline
2. Ensure 12 deals are spread across stages (2 sourced, 3 qualified, 4 pitching, 1 in DD, 1 committed, 1 passed)
3. Load 8 pre-processed interactions with transcripts
4. Load 2 pitch sessions with scores (72 and 68 overall)
5. Set 3 upcoming meetings (Tom Liu tomorrow 2PM, Blake Rhodes Thursday 10AM, new intro Friday 3PM)
6. David Moore should show as committed with no SAFE sent
7. Andrea Kim should show 11 days since last contact with outstanding promise

**Key moments to nail:**
- The Move should feel specific and urgent, not generic
- The stalled deal detection should feel like something the founder genuinely forgot
- The pitch score patterns should feel actionable, not abstract
- The email draft should reference specific conversation points, not boilerplate
- The meeting prep should show knowledge the founder didn't have to compile manually

**Common questions during demo:**

Q: "How does it know David responds in 4 hours on average?"
A: Roundy tracks response latency across all interactions. After 3+ exchanges, it computes average and detects deviations.

Q: "What if I don't use Granola?"
A: You can paste transcripts directly, upload files, or type quick notes. Any text input works.

Q: "Does it work for Series A and later?"
A: Same workflow. The deal stages and complexity scale, but the core loop — interactions in, intelligence out — is the same.

Q: "How is this different from just using Notion or a spreadsheet?"
A: A spreadsheet tracks what you tell it. Roundy extracts insights you'd miss, predicts which deals are real, and tells you what to do about it. After 20 interactions, it knows things about your pipeline that you don't.

Q: "What about data privacy?"
A: All data is workspace-scoped with row-level security. Your interactions are never shared across workspaces. The AI processes your data to serve you — it doesn't train on it.
