# Roundy — Fundraising Chief of Staff

## What It Is
AI-powered fundraising copilot/chief of staff. Built originally to manage Nightjar ($2m round) and Regeneration ($25m + $5m rounds). Now multi-tenant SaaS with paying customers.

## Core Features
- **Granola MCP integration** — every pitch auto-ingested, scored, extracted
- **Pitch improvement** — tracks points hit/missed, improves pitch iteratively
- **Account management** — companies, people, deals (full CRM replacement)
- **Hindsight context graph** — full relationship/interaction graph behind the data
- **Reflect mode** — preparation for meetings, post-meeting analysis
- **3-4 ambient background agents** — process management, next-action nudges
- **Commitment scoring** — analyzes language/transcripts to predict who will actually commit vs who's being polite
- **Nudge system** — keeps founder from bullshitting themselves, surfaces truth about deal pipeline
- **Multi-tenant** — workspace-scoped with super admin / admin roles
- **Payments** — full stack with billing

## Traction
- Paying users (live)
- VC/incubator interest — "I could use this for my 30 portfolio companies"
- Helped Mark close Nightjar round fast

## Go-to-Market
- **Boardy partnership** — Boardy is a viral AI LinkedIn bot that's spoken to 120,000 founders running funding rounds. Distribution channel for Roundy.
- Potential: co-launch with Boardy for $1m ARR, or sell standalone for $2m

## Tech
- Separate machine + GitHub + Claude Code
- Full stack (not on Clawdine's MacBook)

## Also: Hypersend
Stablecoin product Mark built. Being sold off. Not Clawdine's concern — just running the sales process.

*Mark tends to overcook this one. The product is done. The play is distribution (Boardy) and sales, not more building.*
