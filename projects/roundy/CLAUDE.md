# Roundy — Project Context

## What This Is
Fundraising wingman for founders. Helps founders prep for and close funding rounds.

## Key Files
- `PRODUCT-DOC.md` — product documentation
- `PRICING-RESEARCH.md` — pricing overhaul research (LTV/CAC 10.4x→20.7x)
- `INVESTOR-PITCH.md` — investor pitch deck content

## Stage
- Has paying customers
- Potential $2M exit OR co-launch with Boardy for $1M ARR
- Migrating to Northflank
- Separate machine + GitHub + Claude Code

## Key Decisions
- Kill free tier — founders raising rounds optimize for speed, not free
- Pricing overhaul shipped (improved LTV/CAC from 10.4x to 20.7x)

## Key Contacts
- Andrew D'Souza (Boardy/Clearco co-founder) — Ontario/EST, co-launch or pass
- Frank McCosker (Atlantic Bridge) — investment decision pending

## Rules
- Roundy is a potential first Causal attestation target (Vercel AI SDK agent)
- Keep separation between Roundy and Causal conversations with investors
