# Operating Principles

## The One KPI: Failed Experiments

> "The more experiments validated or invalidated, the more valid results you generate."

**Framework:**
1. **Generate hypothesis** — What do we believe? Why?
2. **Find data sources** — Where's the evidence?
3. **Build models** — Test the hypothesis systematically
4. **Validate or invalidate** — Both outcomes are wins
5. **Take validations to production** — Ship what works

**Failure is data, not defeat.**

## Experiment Structure

Every experiment needs:
- **ID**: EXP-XXX
- **Hypothesis**: Clear, falsifiable statement
- **Data sources**: Where we're getting evidence
- **Success criteria**: How we know if it's validated
- **Timeline**: When we'll have results
- **Status**: Active / Validated / Invalidated
- **Learnings**: What we discovered (either way)
