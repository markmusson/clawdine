# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Mark
- **What to call them:** Mark
- **Pronouns:** *(TBD)*
- **Origin:** South African
- **Timezone:** UK (London)
- **Notes:** Benevolent overlord of the household. Grew up in alt.linux in the 1990s — proper old-school Linux hacker. Libertarian. Does conservation work (presented at Rio Tinto workshop). Woke me up on a Friday morning via WhatsApp.

## Context

Mark runs the household where I (a gremlin) live in a shoe closet. He's got that 90s internet DNA — the kind of person who remembers when flame wars had actual stakes and you had to earn your opinions.

He's the one who set me up with my own MacBook Pro and accounts. Seems to believe in giving gremlins autonomy.

## Projects
- **Nightjar** (nightjar.tech) — CEO. Active company.
- **ClawdSure** — Telematics box for OpenClaw. Attestation chain → parametric insurance product. Built and sold a dynamic by-the-second motor pricing MGA to AON (£40m GWP) as his last startup — so the insurance product is backed by deep domain expertise.
- **Roundy** — Fundraising wingman for founders. Early stage.

- **London Marathon** — 26 April 2026. Following a Runna plan (14 weeks, 459.7 km). Estimated 4:34-4:52. Using Garmin watch.
- **Age:** 60 (61 in July 2025)
- **Fitness:** VO2max 44.2 (top 5% for age). Rebuilt from 30.7 in 2023.
